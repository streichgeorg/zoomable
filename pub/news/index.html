                ISIS kidnaps 20 medical workers in Libya

                     (CNN) ISIS kidnapped about 20 medical workers with the Ibn Sina Hospital in Sirte, Libya, on Monday during an attack on the facility, according to a hospital official. A group of more than 30 gunmen from the Islamic State attacked the hospital while a bus was waiting to take the workers, who are not Libyan, to the capital of Tripoli.  Most of the abductees are from the Philippines. Others are from Ukraine, India and Serbia, said the hospital official.  The official believes the ISIS gunmen didn’t want the staff to leave the city because they are the only medical team there if they needed them for the group’s wounded and injured.  Sirte lies halfway between Tripoli and Benghazi. The city was the final major stronghold of Moammar Gadhafi loyalists in the Libyan civil war. Gadhafi was killed there. ISIS took control of the city late last year, including the hospital. The group claimed responsibility for the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in the country about two months ago.  The hospital staff members who were kidnapped were trying to leave the city because of the security situation and the control of ISIS over the city, the official said.

                Tom Hanks gives White House press an espresso machine

                    Washington (CNN) The White House press corps won’t need to worry about staying caffeinated covering the new administration thanks to a new espresso machine gifted by actor Tom Hanks on Thursday. Hanks surprised the press corps for the third time in 13 years with an espresso machine and added a note encouraging the journalists to continue their work. ”Keep up the good fight for the truth, justice and the American way,” Hanks wrote in a note accompanying the gift, which was delivered by mail. ”Especially for the Truth part.” Hanks first sent the press corps an espresso machine in 2004, when he and his family were visiting the White House. The actor was apparently surprised to find working journalists in the press area without a simple coffee pot and had an espresso machine delivered a short time later. In 2010, after visiting the White House grounds again with director Steven Spielberg, Hanks came back to the press area to check on his machine and told the press they weren’t using it correctly. ”You know you are supposed to clean this after every use,” Hanks joked. ”You are supposed to wipe that off. Look at the buildup there!” Hanks then sent another machine that week, saying, ”Let me see what I can do for the poor slobs of the fourth estate.”

                Disney introduces Elena, its first Latina princess

                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) Disney announced Thursday that its newest princess will be Elena of Avalor, a    character inspired by ”diverse Latin cultures and folklore.” She’ll make her debut on Disney Junior’s animated show ”Sofia the First” next year, which is targeted at children ages 2 to 7. Elena’s own eponymous spinoff series is set to premiere in 2016 on Disney Junior, as well as Disney Junior’s programming block on the Disney Channel. Aimee Carrero of ABC Family’s ”Young  Hungry” will voice the role. ’Frozen’: Why kids can’t ’Let It Go’ ”What excites us most is the chance to use distinctive animation and visual design to tell wonderful stories influenced by culture and traditions that are familiar to the worldwide population of Hispanic and Latino families and reflect the interests and aspirations of all children as told through a classic fairy tale,” Nancy Kanter, the executive vice president and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide, said in the announcement. In fall 2012, Disney faced harsh criticism after a producer of the ”Sofia the First” series announced that the title character was Latina. Disney Junior executives later clarified that the princess’ ethnicity had been misrepresented, adding that ”all our characters come from fantasy lands that may reflect elements of various cultures and ethnicities but none are meant to specifically represent those real world cultures.” Disney producer ’misspoke’: ’First Latina princess’ isn’t Latina

                     (CNN) Three Leicester City players apologized Sunday after a video surfaced that reportedly shows them participating in a racist orgy in Thailand. The tape was first obtained and reported by the Sunday Mirror. Leicester City released a statement saying the three soccer players are sorry and would be returning to the UK ahead of the rest of the squad. ”Our players at every level are expected to behave as representatives and ambassadors for our Football Club, both on official Club duty and in their personal lives, so we treat their conduct extremely seriously,” it read. ”Tom Hopper, James Pearson and Adam Smith would like to convey their sincere apologies for their behaviour    to the women involved in the incident, to the Club and its owners, to the Club’s fans and to their families,” the statement said. Snippets of the tape published by the Sunday Mirror show the three players, naked, in what appears to be a hotel room. One of the players says a woman is ”an absolute one out of 10.” A woman is later called a ”slit eye.” The newspaper reported that the footage was shared by at least one of the players with friends back in the United Kingdom. James Pearson is the son of Nigel Pearson, Leicester City manager. The English soccer club is owned by the   King Power International. ”A formal process of investigation will be undertaken with the players in conjunction with their representatives and, as such, no further comment can be made at this stage,” Leicester City said.

He asked Clinton if she believed her statement or if it was simply an attempt to slam Vermont and Sanders, who represents the state in the US Senate.’ ’Clinton, the former secretary of state, said, ”Of course not.” She said that gun control was simply an issue where she has ”a lot of difference” with Sanders.’ ’Sanders chuckled while Clinton gave the answer.’ ’”This isn’’t a laughing matter,” Clinton shot back. ”Ninety people on average are killed or commit suicide or die from accidents with guns [every day]  —   33, 000 people a year.

                    ’  ’ ’   Cam Newton was unhappy with the officiating after the Carolina   Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals,   on Sunday. ’ ’   Though he was officially sacked just once and knocked down four   times, Newton felt that once again he was subjected to late hits   by defenders. ’ ’   Newton addressed the situation after the game, saying he was   going to talk to the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, about the   situation because he no longer felt safe on the field. ’ ’   ”It’’s really taking the fun out of the game for me,” Newton said.   ”Honestly, it really is. Because, at times, I don’’t even feel   safe.” ’ ’   Newton continued, saying that when he brought the issue up to   refs throughout his career, they said they missed the calls.   Newton called it ”bullcrap.” ’ ’   ”The story of my life, ever since I came in, was, ’’Oh, I missed   that one. Oh, I’’m sorry, I’’ll try to get it. ’’ That’’s bullcrap,   that’’s bullcrap. Players in this league, we do something stupid,   we get fined . .. And I can’’t just keep accepting, ’’Oh, we missed   that one,’’ or, ’’I apologize for doing that,’’ or, ’’I didn’’t see   it. ’’ That’’s horsecrap.” ’ ”   Newton said that for every flag a different quarterback draws for   taking a hit, he could name a hit in which he didn’t draw a flag.   When asked what his breaking point in Week 8 was, Newton said a   particular play could have torn his ACL. ” ”   Here’s video of some of the Cardinals’ hits on Newton, with   Newton’s postgame comments, via Fox: ” ’ ’ ”   Hits on Newton have been a point of contention since the   Panthers’ first game of the season. Facing the Denver Broncos,    some of   which came late (after he had gotten rid of the ball) and went   uncalled. Additionally, Newton wasn’t taken out of the game to   undergo tests for a concussion. ” ’  ’

                Here’s the biggest reason Apple might want to acquire Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal

                    ’  ’ ’   A  said   Apple was in early talks to acquire Tidal, the     service owned by rapper Jay Z and a collection of his friends. ’ ”   On the face of it, that seems like a rather strange deal. Apple   already has its own   service, Apple Music. And   Tidal isn’t exactly a runaway success. Many of its subscribers   come through deals with telecoms companies. ” ”   But there’s one big reason Tidal could be an attractive prospect   for Apple: the sheer number of artists who are on board with the   platform and giving it exclusives. ” ”   Here’s a photo from Tidal’s relaunch event in New York in March   2015. ” ’  ’ ”   Standing onstage are some of the biggest names in music, and   that’s not even the full lineup of musicians who backed the   company at launch. Many of them have published exclusive music to   the service, too, which is a big draw for consumers. ” ”   Of course, Apple has bought a   service before.    best known for its line of headphones, in   2014. But that deal also included the company’s     platform as well as key figures inside the company like dealmaker   Jimmy Iovine, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, and rapper   Dr. Dre. ” ’   If you want to know why Apple might acquire Tidal, then look at   the reasons it acquired Beats. Yes, there was the     component, but far more valuable was the   expertise   and contacts that came with hiring someone like Iovine. ’ ” that Iovine was the driving force   behind Apple’s   service. He’s the      dealmaker who has been helping bring in   exclusives. And which other   service is going all   in on exclusives? Tidal. ” ”   Acquiring Jay Z’s startup may not directly bring in a huge uptick   in subscribers for Apple Music, but it would at least help Apple   secure more exclusives and build relations with more people in   the music industry. ”

                McCain: Dictators ’get started by suppressing free press’
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) Sen. John McCain slammed President Donald Trump’s attacks on the media this week by noting dictators ”get started by suppressing free press.” It was a startling observation from a sitting member of Congress against the President of the United States, especially considering McCain is a member of Trump’s party. ”I hate the press,” the Arizona Republican sarcastically told NBC News’ Chuck Todd on ”Meet the Press.” ”I hate you especially. But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It’s vital.” But he continued, ”If you want to preserve    I’m very serious now    if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press,” McCain said in the interview. ”And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That’s how dictators get started.” A clip of the interview, which airs in full on Sunday, was released Saturday afternoon. McCain has been a frequent critic of the President, particularly in the areas of foreign policy and national security, since before Trump entered the White House. The 2008 Republican presidential nominee said Americans must pay attention to history to understand the past connections between leaders of oppressive governments and efforts to stifle the media. ”They get started by suppressing free press, in other words, a consolidation of power    when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press,” McCain said. ”And I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.” Trump tweeted Friday that CNN and other major media outlets were ”the enemy of the American people.” CNN contributor Carl Bernstein, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Watergate scandal, which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, called Trump’s words ”treacherous.” ”The most dangerous ’enemy of the people’ is presidential lying    always,” he tweeted. ”Attacks on press by @realDonaldTrump more treacherous than Nixon’s.”

Both candidates seem disturbingly disconnected, in their   own ways. Hillary Clinton from the people. Donald Trump from   rationality.” ’ ’   ”I’m feeling less apathetic about this election,” she added.   ”It’s not that Clinton has shown herself to be more than just the   lesser of two evils. It’s that her impending victory represents   the triumph of nuance and poise over prejudice and childishness.   And that’s something I can get excited about.” ’ ’President Donald Trump is ”very upset” that. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’

                     (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, rolled out the red carpet for President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump at Ben Gurion International Airport Monday morning, but one moment stood out: a flick of the wrist seen ’round the world. As the Trumps and the Netanyahus walked the red carpet following a formal welcoming ceremony and remarks, the President seems to reach for his wife’s hand. The first lady appears to swat her husband’s hand away with a visible flick of her wrist. The White House has not responded to CNN’s request for comment and context on the moment, but the video clip is already going viral.  RELATED: Can Donald Trump solve the   conflict? ”Well this is embarrassing,” Israeli publication Haaretz wrote on its official Twitter account with a slow motion clip of the moment. The tweet has nearly 30, 000 retweets as of this writing.  That said, the Trumps have held hands multiple times during their foreign travels this week, including minutes later on the tarmac. They briefly held hands in Saudi Arabia as they entered the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology. And after the   swat, they arrived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre hand in hand.   RELATED: Trump sets sight on the big deal: Mideast peace, It’s unclear what caused the swat, if anything. Perhaps the first lady, who studied extensively ahead of the trip, did not want to buck protocol, since their Israeli counterparts did not appear to be holding hands at that particular moment. Or maybe there was a bug. If it was indeed intentional, it’s not the first time the first lady has used body language publicly to steer her husband. She gently nudged him to place his hand on his heart as the national anthem played during the White House Easter Egg Roll last month.  RELATED: Donald Trump denies a Russia allegation that no one made, There had already been some confusion as the two couples walked the carpet ahead of the ceremony.  ”They have all this protocol, we never know what to do,” Netanyahu joked.  ”What is the protocol? Do you have any idea?” Trump asked.  ”Who knows!” Netanyahu said, laughing.

Barack Obama’s support with black voters over Clinton in 2008. The numbers were even higher than the results in Nevada, where  of the black vote. And they were more significant, as black voters made up more than 60% of the electorate.” ’’ ” recently that the narrow losses in Iowa and Nevada loss may made Sanders’ path to victory more difficult. ” ’As returns suggested a landslide victory for Clinton in South Carolina, some observers said the win forecast similar results on Super Tuesday, as the Democratic electorate is much more racially diverse in the participating states.’ ’”SC results are very clear, absent Sanders dramatically expanding his base on Super Tuesday, the Dem nomination fight is over on Wednesday AM,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, .’ ”While Sen.

I have other priorities. I have a grandchild now. But I am fully dedicated to using as much time as I can to support whoever the chairman is.” A leading contender for the spot is Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is still in the running for the position despite criticism over his past ties to the Nation of Islam and his defense of its leader, Louis Farrakhan, resurfacing in the news this week. Ellison distanced himself from the group during his first congressional run a decade ago.  Dean served as the governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and gained a national following during his bid for 2004 Democratic nomination by drawing support online    a fairly novel concept at the time    which came up short. Dean then in early 2005 won a spirited contest to chair the DNC. During his tenure Democrats won control of the House in 2006, and Barack Obama won the presidency two years later.  Dean earlier this month threw his hat in the ring for the reprise of that role, and was expected to be among Ellison’s most formidable challengers. ”The dems need organization and focus on the young,” Dean tweeted earlier this month, proposing to renew the strategy. ”Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.” The current head of the DNC is Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative and former CNN contributor, who is leading in an interim capacity after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on the eve of the party’s convention last summer. Hacked emails appeared to show Wasserman Schultz and other   DNC officials discussing ways to undermine Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ efforts against Hillary Clinton in the primary. Dean said late Friday afternoon he came to his decision ”two or three weeks ago. Once I was in, I got a quick lay of the land. I think that I would have and could have won just with what we were able to accomplish last time I was chair,” Dean told MSNBC on Friday. Dean also sized up current rivals to Ellison for the party leadership. He called Jaime Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, a ”good candidate” and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley ”very experienced.” ”I may make an endorsement down the line,” Dean said.

                How to Plan a Weekend Getaway - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Can’t take time off for a weeklong vacation? Getting away for a weekend is still a way to recharge your batteries, said Shawna Huffman Owen, the president of Huffman Travel, a travel consultancy based in Chicago. “If you plan well,” she said, “a quick trip can be a great break and even feel longer than it is. ” As a frequent weekend vacationer, she has plenty of advice on getting the most out of a little time off. Here, her top tips: KNOW YOUR GOAL Do you want to completely disconnect and relax, be active, hit popular nightclubs and restaurants or bond with your family? “Your weekend trip will be a waste if it doesn’t accomplish what you’re looking to do,” Ms. Huffman Owen said. Travelers interested in cultural attractions, for example, might not appreciate a stay in a countryside retreat with few sights nearby, while those who like to be pampered wouldn’t enjoy a property without a spa or one where the spa is small and has a limited menu of services. Plan a trip according to what interests you most. PICK AN    DESTINATION Enjoying your destination  —   not spending all of your time traveling to and from it  —   is crucial when you have limited time off. Consider places that are within a   drive or a nonstop flight from home. For travelers who live on the East Coast or in the Midwest of the United States, Ms. Huffman Owen’s favorite spots for weekend trips include South Beach, Charleston, Quebec City, Montreal, Newport and the New England region West Coast and Southwest residents could consider Cabo San Lucas or San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and Big Sur, Vancouver, Seattle, Sonoma and Napa. FULFILL A DREAM The exception to choosing an easily accessible destination, Ms. Huffman Owen said, is using your weekend getaway to fulfill a travel fantasy such as flying to Paris to have dinner in that    restaurant you have always wanted to dine at, going to London to catch a tennis match at Wimbledon or heading to Morocco for a   trek in the Sahara, a trip that the adventure travel company Epic Tomato can arrange. “Trips like these may require more effort and a bigger budget,” she said, “but they will be ones that you will never forget and can be rejuvenating in their own way. ” DO YOUR HOMEWORK Planning is crucial to making the most of your weekend away and avoiding disappointment. If you’re heading to a spa, for example, be sure to book treatments and fitness classes as far in advance as possible because many spas can be fully booked on weekends, and exercise classes, such as spinning, may have a limit on the number of participants. It’s also a good idea to book tables at nightclubs and restaurants, and reserve theater tickets and poolside and beachside cabanas at resorts.

                Suspect charged in killings of NY imam, assistant

                    New York (CNN) A Brooklyn man has been charged with one count of   murder and two counts of   murder in connection with the shooting deaths of a New York imam and his assistant, prosecutors said Tuesday.  The suspect, Oscar Morel, 35, was originally arrested Sunday night on charges related to a    accident,  New York police Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce said Monday night at a news conference. During a search, police found a revolver and clothing believed to have been used by the alleged gunman in the fatal shootings. A law enforcement official said the items turned up in a wall of the suspect’s home. Morel also was charged with two counts of felony criminal possession of a weapon. On Saturday, Imam Maulama Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Uddin, 64, were gunned down after prayers at a nearby mosque, police said. There is no indication that it was a hate crime, police said.  Police had indicated that Morel would be charged with two counts of   murder but prosecutors upped one of the charges when Morel was arraigned Tuesday afternoon. Morel did not enter a plea. He is being held without bail, said Ikimulisa Livingston, a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney’s Office said.  CNN left a message seeking comment at the attorney who represented Morel in court.  Walking after midday prayers, Akonjee and Uddin were shot in the head about 1:50 p. m. in Ozone Park, a   section of Queens with a burgeoning Bangladeshi population.  ”There is nothing in the preliminary investigation that would indicate they were targeted because of their faith,” New York police Deputy Inspector Henry Sautner told reporters Saturday. The victims were wearing religious attire at the time of the shooting, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation.    Jame Masjid Mosque is about two blocks from where the men were gunned down. They were walking home after midday prayers. Nazim Uddin, a neighbor of the imam, told CNN he ran outside from his home when he heard gunfire. He remembered the imam as a good man who had delivered a eulogy at the mosque the day before.  What the investigation found, Police said surveillance video captured the gunman leaving the scene with a weapon in hand. Officers reviewed surveillance video that placed a black GMC Trailblazer at the scene of the killings, Boyce said. Officers were conducting surveillance of the suspect’s vehicle when they observed him enter his car. When the detectives approached him, the suspect allegedly rammed into their vehicle several times with his Trailblazer, according to Boyce.   The man was arrested after crashing into the unmarked police car.  No motive in the killings has been determined, Boyce said. Morel’s next court appearance is scheduled for August 18, which is his birthday.

                MARK CUBAN: Here’s what ’concerns me more than anything’ about Trump

                    ’  ’ ’   Billionaire business mogul Mark Cuban  that President Donald Trump   needed to communicate more with the American people who disagreed   with him or risk becoming ”more and more divisive.” ’ ’   Cuban, who has expressed dismay at times with the president on   Twitter, explained what concerned him most about Trump,   criticizing him for using Twitter as a main tool of communication   with the general public. ’ ’   ”The reality is, what, 15% of Americans are on Twitter?” he said.   ”So it’’s the media that really communicates with most of us. And   if you have all these technology tools available, why not use   them? Why not go on, give an   analysis or details of why   you want to do or why you’’re doing what you’’re doing. We’’re just   not seeing any of that, and that’’s what concerns me more than   anything.” ’ ’   Cuban, the owner of the NBA’’s Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC’’s   ”Shark Tank” who was also a prominent surrogate for Democrat   Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, spoke with   CNBC after a weekend in which  executive   order temporarily banning travel and refugee resettlement from   seven   countries. ’ ’   The order was met with backlash by many business leaders and   politicians, and it led to mass chaos at airports and nationwide   protests. ’ ’   ”Everything seems rushed,” Cuban said, adding: ”Everybody wants   to be safe. If he’’s going to keep us safe, why did he leave so   many countries that host terrorism off the list? He was very   clear during the campaign that ISIS was everywhere. So if we’’re   trying to stay safe, why leave it off? Maybe he’’s got a good   reason for it, but he’’s not communicating that to any of us.” ’ ’   ”’’Make America Safe Again’’ sounds really, really good if you’’re   trying to raise money for a deal,” he later continued. ”It   doesn’’t sound really good when it’’s obvious that a significant   portion of the country doesn’’t understand it or doesn’’t agree   with it.” ’ ’   Circling back to Twitter, Cuban called Trump’’s tweets   ”ridiculous” but said he was ”glad” Trump ”does them” because ”it   gives us a window into how he thinks.” ’ ’   ”Part of the bigger problem with Donald Trump is, when you sit   and talk to him    he’’s reasonable, he comes across as   caring, he’’s   but then all of that just is thrown out   the window when he tweets and when he communicates with the media   and when he communicates at all,” he said. ’ ’   Cuban said Twitter was ”not the real world” and he was ”torched”   on the social network when he spoke in favor of Clinton. He added   that Twitter had changed considerably since Trump was elected and   that, while he had hoped for Clinton’’s victory, he wanted Trump   to succeed. ’ ’   ”Those days are gone, he’’s our president,” he said. ”He’’s most   likely the president for the next four years.” ’ ’ ’

                    ’  ’ ’   Major League Baseball owners have  during the 2016 campaign cycle  —   and a handful   have accounted for nearly all of that total. ’ ’   According to a new study from the Center for Responsibility and   Ethics in Washington, no ownership group is more politically   engaged at the donor level than the Ricketts family, who happen   to own the Chicago Cubs  —   currently battling the Cleveland   Indians for the World Series title. ’ ’   And the family  —   which has a member, Peter Ricketts, serving   as the Republican governor of Nebraska  —   has a huge ideological   divide.   ’ ’   Laura Ricketts, a   donated $483, 000 to a Super PAC   dedicated to supporting   candidates for office. She also   contributed to a host of Democratic congressional campaigns, in   addition to providing $100, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. ’ ’   Her brothers, Todd and Tom, combined to donate roughly $60, 000 to   a score of Republican House and Senate candidates, while their   father, Joe Ricketts, who is often closely associated with the   team but does not have an official role, put $1 million behind an     Trump Super PAC earlier in the cycle. In September,   he relented, and put his support behind the Republican nominee. ’ ’   Providing the most money to Trump was Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey   Loria, who sent $125, 000 last month to Trump Victory. On the   flip side, former NBA superstar and   of the Los Angeles   Dodgers Magic Johnson provided the most cash for Clinton, making   a $250, 000 donation to the Hillary Victory Fund. ’ ’  ’ ”   The executive owner who made the most political   contributions was Robert Castellini of the Cincinnati Reds,   providing more than $600, 000 in funds to Republican presidential   and congressional candidates. He put $50, 000 into a Super PAC   backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential bid, nearly $8, 000   to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise Super PAC,   $150, 000 to an   Super PAC, as well as money that went   to support Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of   Pennsylvania, and House Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. ” ”   Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos also dumped money into   campaigns in a similar manner as Castellini, except he was   providing cash to Democrats. Angelos gave more than $270, 000 to   the Super PAC formed to encourage Vice President Joe Biden to   seek for the presidency. He was the biggest donor to the   Super PAC, Draft Biden 2016. He’s also made donations to the   Hillary Victory Fund, and in support of Reps. Elijah Cummings and   Chris Van Hollen of Maryland as well as Sen. Patrick Leahy of   Vermont. ” ”   Some other prominent donations included New York Mets owner Fred   Wilpon giving $100, 000 to a   Christie Super PAC back   when the New Jersey governor was still seeking the presidency.   Texas Rangers   Ray Davis made a $100, 000 contribution to   Bush’s Right to Rise Super PAC, and John Malone, an investor in   the group that owns the Atlanta Braves, contributed $100, 000 to a   super PAC supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential   bid. ”

                The Russia story just keeps getting worse for President Trump
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Washington (CNN) Two stories dealing with Russia’s meddling in the election broke Tuesday night. And both were full of bad news for President Donald Trump. The first, an exclusive to CNN, revealed that a number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees who have seen classified documents see no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, further suggesting Rep. Devin Nunes,   misled Trump (and the public) when he described documents relating to the unmasking of Trump campaign officials caught up in an incidental collection operation by the intelligence community. Write CNN’s Jim Sciutto, Manu Raju and Eric Bradner: ”Their private assessment contradicts President Donald Trump’s allegations that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice broke the law by requesting the ”unmasking” of US individuals’ identities. Trump had claimed the matter was a ’massive story. ’” The second, broken by The Washington Post, reveals that the FBI obtained a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court court warrant in August 2016 aimed at monitoring the communications of   Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The key paragraph: ”The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.” Scroll up. Read that one again. It’s a ”wow.” Page has denied any wrongdoing.  What’s become clear over the first few months of the Trump White House is that we aren’t in the midst of a ”he   said” when it comes to the campaign’s ties to Russia. It’s more of a ”he   said, he said, she said, he said, he said” sort of situation. As in, on the one hand, we have Trump asserting that the whole story of Russia’s attempts to influence the election via connections within his campaign apparatus is ”fake news,” and grasping at the idea that somehow, some way he will be eventually proven right in his baseless claims that   Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. On the other, we have FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the heads of both the House and Senate intelligence committees    both Republicans    and lots and lots of other prominent voices within the intelligence community insisting the Russian investigation is entirely justified and that no evidence exists for Trump’s claims. It’s not a fair fight    and shouldn’t be presented as one. And that has zero to do with partisanship and everything to do with the facts as we know them. The best path forward for President Trump as it relates to Russia is to pivot from his current      stance to one in which he embraces both the congressional and Justice Department investigations into the Russian meddling into the election. Given the amount of smoke surrounding Trump’s campaign and Russia, it’s no longer really a question whether it merits an investigation into whether there’s some fire at its center. Simply because that’s the path Trump should take, of course, doesn’t mean it’s the one he will choose. In fact, for someone who prides himself on zigging when everyone thinks he should zag, Trump likely won’t follow this path. But all that ensures is that the Russia story will just keep getting worse for him and his administration.

                Reward offered in Central Park case
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    New York (CNN) Nearly six months after a homemade bomb blew off the foot of a visiting college student in New York’s Central Park, investigators have run out of leads.  Authorities on Friday offered a $25, 000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for planting the device. The July 3 explosion rattled a city already on edge from attacks around the world and left the athletic Connor Golden with a prosthetic leg. With the reward, authorities hope to bring renewed attention to a case that, according to law enforcement officials, has gone cold.  It was warm on that Sunday morning    the day before Independence Day    when Golden, an    from the University of Miami, and two of his friends, jumped off a rock in the park. Golden landed on a   shopping bag loaded with a deadly chemical mix. He suffered severe injuries and underwent surgeries to remove the lower part of his left leg. Witnesses said the sound of the blast ripped through the park like a shot from a ”cannon,” scaring birds off trees. Some assumed it was a firework given the holiday weekend. Explosive used in terror attacks, Investigators initially thought along those lines too    evidence suggested the work of amateur hobbyists possibly experimenting with explosives during the July 4 festivities, bomb squad commanding officer Lt. Mark Torre said shortly after the blast.  Investigators said in July they believed someone was testing how to make the explosive, which they say is common. The device had been made with the homemade explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) which has been used in terrorist attacks    including in the Paris attacks last fall and by the   ”shoe bomber” Richard Reid. But despite witness interviews and reviews of surveillance video and cell phone tower records, law enforcement had made no arrests as of Friday.  Golden and his two companions, who were both uninjured, are not believed to have played any role in the construction of the explosive device, authorities said.  The only major lead    a scrap of the bag that led authorities to a defunct bakery in New Jersey    did not pan out.  Reward offer not tied to new development, On Friday, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the New York Police Department announced the reward to ”spur some people to come forward with information who may not have done so before.” ”Perhaps someone will remember some forgotten or unreported detail that may prove important to the investigation,” said Matthew Myerson, a spokesman for the ATF New York field division.  The decision to offer the reward was not tied to a particular development in the investigation or elsewhere, Myerson said. In an interview, Connor’s father, Kevin Golden, said his family was excited about the prospects of the reward.  ”It’s not good that they don’t have a bunch of leads to work on, but they’re doing something about it and hopefully that will generate more leads from the public,” Golden said.  Connor Golden, now 19, was able to return only a week late to the University of Miami for his sophomore year, where he’s making steady progress, his father said. The rehabilitation process is slow, and practice with the prosthetic is like a whole new way of walking, he said, but the family is encouraged. ”He was just telling me today he thinks there will come a time in the not too distant future where he’ll feel like windsurfing again,” Golden said. ”It’s amazing to think of him doing that.”

                Bones Aboard South Korean Ferry Stir Hope, Then Anguish, in Relatives - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    SEOUL, South Korea  —   Hopes rose and then were crushed on Tuesday when South Korean officials reported, and then retracted, the finding of human bones from the ferry Sewol, which sank nearly three years ago, killing more than 300 people. When officials announced at a news briefing that they had found what they “believed were the bones of a missing person,’’ relatives of the nine passengers still missing, who have never given up hope of finding the remains of their loved ones, broke into tears. But hours later, the authorities withdrew the announcement. In a brief statement sent to journalists, they said that the bones were not from a human but from “an animal. ’’ Some local news reports said the bones belonged to a pig. Hopes of recovering the missing passengers have risen since the   ferry was finally lifted from the sea bottom last Thursday. The Sewol, structurally unbalanced and overloaded, capsized and then sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16, 2014. The underwater search of the ferry ended after divers recovered the 295th body, a   girl, from one of the ship’s restrooms on Oct. 28, 2014. After the ferry was raised last week, it was positioned on its side on a large   vessel as salvage crews drained it before taking it to a nearby port for a closer inspection. On Tuesday, they found six bones, a shoe and other personal items, which had apparently washed out of the ferry as it was being drained. Government forensic experts were sent to the scene to collect the remains. Most of the victims were students from Danwon High School in Ansan, south of Seoul, who had boarded the ferry for a trip to an island. The nine who are still missing include four students and two teachers from the school. The sinking, one of the country’s worst disasters, was a deeply traumatizing experience for South Koreans. When the Sewol capsized, its crew members were among the first to flee, after repeatedly telling passengers to stay in their cabins. As the ship slowly went under, teenagers trapped inside sent text messages begging for help or saying goodbye to their families. Confusing news reports and official announcements at the time added to South Koreans’ pain over the disaster. Local news outlets initially reported that all on board the Sewol had been rescued. And the government kept releasing conflicting information on the number of people on board and the number of those rescued. Bereaved families had demanded that the ship be salvaged, hoping that the bodies of the missing would be found inside. “ ! Hang in there just a bit more, so we can go home together,” Lee   said in tears on Tuesday, throwing yellow roses into the sea. Her daughter, Cho   a Danwon student, was one of the nine missing. Around the time the bones were found, Ms. Lee and others with missing relatives joined emotional religious services on a boat near the Sewol, during which Catholic pastors, Protestant ministers and Buddhist monks prayed for the recovery of the nine’s remains. “Please support us until I can hold my daughter’s hands and finally go home,” said Park   the mother of another missing student, Heo   according to pool reports by South Korean journalists at the scene. Ever since the ferry’s sinking, relatives of the missing have camped out at a nearby pier, in hopes that their loved ones’ remains would eventually be found. On Tuesday, friends and supporters of the families gathered there and released yellow balloons into the sky wishing for a successful recovery.

                US joins first air assault ’behind enemy lines’ against ISIS in Syria
            </div>

                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Washington (CNN) Fighters in Syria have begun a major ground offensive, backed up by US forces, to retake a vital dam near Raqqa, Syria, from ISIS, a US official told CNN Wednesday. The attack also included an unprecedented air assault involving US helicopters landing behind enemy lines    flying about 500 local US allies and coalition military advisers across the Euphrates River and Lake Assad so they could attack the   dam and neighboring town and airfield from the south. ”This is the first time we have conducted an air movement, air assault, with the Syrian Arab Coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces,” Col. Joseph Scrocca, a coalition public affairs officer, said. On a call with reporters from Baghdad Wednesday, Scrocca called the air operation a ”daring assault behind enemy lines.” Scrocca would not say how many troops were involved, but a military source said about 500 troops were airlifted behind enemy lines. The attack was backed by US Marines firing M777 howitzers and close air support, including airstrikes carried out by Apache helicopters. But ISIS remains in control of the area after the attack, and weeks of tough fighting could remain, Scrocca said. ”We believe there are foreign fighters there, probably in the hundreds,” he said. ”The (Syrian Democratic Forces) and our partners there are facing a pretty heavy fight    that’s what makes this type of operation so daring. I think we were lucky we caught ISIS by surprise. They are still reacting to this maneuver.” Tabqa Dam is located 25 miles west of Raqqa, ISIS’   capital, and supplies electric power to a wide area of Syria, according to the US. The area has been under ISIS control since 2013. Retaking the dam is considered a vital step toward further isolating the area around Raqqa and eventually recapturing the city. The dam and surrounding terrain is a key military asset because it’s ”critical for the isolation of Raqqa and the next step toward an annihilation of ISIS in Syria,” but the dam’s destruction ”could lead to a severe humanitarian crisis,” Scrocca warned. US Marines equipped with artillery arrived in northern Syria earlier this month with the goal of accelerating the capabilities of the   Arab and Kurdish forces there. The Pentagon and Marine Corps declined to confirm the deployment because of security concerns in the region. They also declined to specify the exact location of the forces or how many are there. A similar deployment last year near Mosul, Iraq, involved several hundred Marines equipped with artillery guns to provide covering fire for advancing forces. The US believes the pressure on ISIS in Raqqa is working. A US official told reporters on March 8 that intelligence indicates some ISIS leaders and operatives continue to try to leave the city.  There is also US intelligence that indicates the city is laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and houses and buildings wired to explode, the official said. If correct, it indicates that the US has likely been able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that ”Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS,” and added that the group still has some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. ISIS could have as many as 4, 000 fighters in Raqqa, according to very rough US estimates, the official said. Since November, the terror group has lost some 3, 400 square kilometers around Raqqa, in a wide arc north of the city.

                Analyst: Snap’s ’core health is very poor’ but there is a silver lining

                    ’  ’ ”   Financial analysts have now had a bit of time to pore over   Snap’s finances and issue their opinions, since it released   its IPO prospectus on Thursday. ” ’   One such analyst is James Gellert, CEO of . ’ ”   His mission is a little different to the average analyst. Instead   of Wall Street’s usual      view, Gellert   rates over 60, 000 public and private companies to see how likely   they are to default on their financial commitments, possibly   even to the point of bankruptcy. ” ’   Overall, Snap isn’’t at high risk to default. But it’’s not at low   risk either, Gellert finds. It rated a   meaning a medium   risk. The problem? Its ”core health is very poor,” Gellert writes   in his report on the company. ’ ’   Snap ”demonstrates weakness in earnings performance, operating   profitability, net profitability and capital structure efficiency   relative to the global industry set,” he writes, based on   analyzing Snap’’s finances over the last 12 months. ’ ”   In particular, Gellert says Snap’s capex efficiency is in the   lowest   percentile compared to other companies   globally. ” ’  ’ ”   That is, perhaps, to be expected. Snap is a young company growing   quickly and is dependent on   data centers (aka cloud   computing) to run its company. Last month, Snap signed a     $2 billion with Google to provide cloud services that   guarantees Google a payment of $400 million a year. Snap’s entire   revenue for 2016 was just over $404 million. ” ”   Snap has always used Google’s cloud and has been touted as one of   the Google cloud’s biggest success stories. In fact, Alphabet’s   venture capital arm, CapitalG,  ” ’   However, Snap may not be so dependent on Google forever. In the   fall, months before it signed this   deal, the company   famously hired  to lead its engineering team. ’ ’   Plus, it indicated in its SEC documents that it ”may invest in   building our own infrastructure” and that it is also ”currently   negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for   redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.” ’ ’   The company offers no real hints about who that provider might   be. However, it does say that it worked with Oracle Data Cloud to   study how ads that run on its apps drive   sales of   consumer goods. It would be a huge coupe for Oracle to snare   some or all of Snap away from Google. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Twitter showed a showed a similar Financial Health profile   back in 2013 at the time of its IPO, but that’s not to say that   Snap is in for the same kind of trouble,”he says.  ’ ’   ”Snap has the unique opportunity to learn from Twitter’s giant   missteps, and if it’s going to have success, it needs to   capitalize,” he says. ’ ”   Plus, there’s no reason to believe Snap will experience Twitter’s   same problems. ” ’   ”The revolving door of management and lack of coherent product   direction at Twitter killed confidence. Their   CEO plan   is a bizarre and controversial decision. Snap needs to convey   direction, a path to profitability, and grow a team that has   confidence and stays with the company to then deliver results,”   he says. ’ ”   Then again, Snap has its own hurdle to overcome: it’s culture of   secrecy. ” ’   ”As a company that historically hasn’t conveyed much direction   and taken pride in its secrecy, even internally, this is a new   world. The public eye is sure to bring many challenges for Snap’s   management team considering the public equity markets don’t like   opacity,” Gellert says. ’ ’Financial analysts have now had a bit of. ..’

                Speculation is mounting that Mark Zuckerberg wants to serve in government

                    ’  ’ ’   Lately, Mark Zuckerberg has been acting more like a   statesman than a tech CEO. ’ ”   The Facebook founder’s  is to tour the U. S. and meet people in   every state, which sounds a lot like a political campaign. ” ’   He recently  and that he sees   religion as ”very important.” ’ ’   In early 2016, he asked Facebook’’s board to  for up to two years, according to legal documents. The   documents, which are from a shareholder lawsuit against Facebook,   indicate that Zuckerberg was  even when one of   his board members called it ”particularly irresponsible.” ’ ”   Yet another indication of Zuckerberg’s interest in public   office is a leaked August 2015 email from Facebook COO   Sheryl Sandberg to former Hillary Clinton campaign   chairman John Podesta. ” ’   In the email, which was published by Wikileaks, Sandberg asks   Podesta to meet with Zuckerberg. She said that Zuckerberg had   been ”meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his   philanthropy and social action.” ’ ’   ”As you may know, he’s young and hungry to learn  —   always in   learning mode  —   and is early in his career when it comes to his   philanthropic efforts,” Sandberg wrote to Podesta. ’ ’   ”He’s begun to think about   he might want to shape   advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is   particularly interested in meeting people who could help him   understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy   issues he cares most about,” she continued. ”He wants to   meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective   political operations to advance public policy goals on social   oriented objectives (like immigration, education or basic   scientific research).” ’ ’   Zuckerberg would end up announcing his philanthropic fund, the   Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, with his wife later that year. ’ ’  ’ ’   If Zuckerberg did decide to step into public office, he could   very well choose be a cabinet member of some kind rather than run   for president. His proposal to serve for up to two years without   losing control of Facebook is obviously not long enough for a     presidential term. ’ ”   But as  Zuckerberg could technically serve   in government for more than two years if he still owns at   least 30% of the capital shares in Facebook that he   had as of June 2016 and discusses it with the   company’s board of independent directors. ” ”   If he owns less than 30% of the capital shares he had   in June 2016 and wants to serve for more than two years, he has   to get approval from the majority of Facebook’s independent   directors, according to the company’s filing with the SEC. ” ”   Facebook did not immediately return a request for comment about   Zuckerberg’s potential political aspirations. ” ”   In his role as one of the most influential CEOs in tech,   Zuckerberg has already had various   interactions with governments. He’s publicly said that   one of the coolest parts of his job is meeting important figures   and politicians from around the world. He’s met with President   Obama several times over the past eight years, but was . ” ’   In  explaining his 2017 goal to meet people   from every state, Zuckerberg explained how he thinks about   the role of technology from a political perspective. ’ ’   ”Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in   history,” he said. ”For decades, technology and globalization   have made us more productive and connected. This has created many   benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more   challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division   than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change   the game so it works for everyone.” ’

                A dark and familiar cloud is hanging over France’s high-stakes presidential election

                    ’  ’ ”   France’s upcoming presidential election has turned into a de   facto referendum on whether to halt or strengthen the   nationalist fervor sweeping the west that propelled US President   Donald Trump into the White House last year and spurred Britain’s   exit from the European Union. ” ”   Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has been accused of   meddling in both the US election to help elect Trump and the   Brexit vote to help fracture the EU, has two horses   in France’s race  —   the   National Front leader   Marine Le Pen, and the   Republicans candidate   Francois Fillon. ” ’   Both candidates have touted policies that are at once     and hostile to two institutions Putin   abhors: the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).   They also oppose western sanctions on Russia and advocate a   closer relationship between France and Moscow.  ’ ’   Le Pen has vowed to pull France out of both the EU and NATO,   comparing Europe to a prison and calling NATO ”obsolete.”   Fillon’’s view of the institutions is more nuanced, but he has   indicated that he would like to see the EU’’s power   diminished and  as an arm of   ”American imperalism.”  ’ ’   Le Pen  —   who has said she admires Putin and thinks sanctions on   Russia are ”completely stupid”  —   traveled to Moscow in late March   to meet with the Russian president. Fillon,   who is : He has sought to justify Russia’’s invasion of   eastern Ukraine, demanded that the US lift its     sanctions, and has advocated for France to realign with Russia,   Iran, and Syrian president Bashar Assad to fight terrorism. ’ ’  ’ ”   The stakes are high for Russia. Depending on who wins, the French   election could set the tone for a broader European shift   toward Moscow and away from Washington. It is no surprise,   then, that both the French and   versions of   Russia’s   news agencies, including Sputnik and   Russia Today (RT) have been conspicuously bolstering the   Kremlin’s candidates. ” ’   RT featured Le Pen’’s statement about Thursday’’s terror attack in   Paris at the top of its site on Friday: ”,” the headline read.  made no mention of the statement   released by her centrist opponent, Emmanuel Macron, in the wake   of Thursday’’s attack: ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   ”It’’s enough to see which candidates, Marine Le Pen or Francois   Fillon, Russia expresses preference for in the French electoral   campaign,” Ayrault told the French .   ”Whereas Emmanuel Macron, who is   is being targeted by   cyberattacks.” ’ ’   ”This form of interference in French democratic life is   unacceptable and I denounce it,” he added. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Another study published by the   private research   group Bakamo  several ”alternative” news   sources widely shared on Facebook and Twitter  —   whose stated aim   is to ”counter the narrative of the traditional media”  —   cite   Russian sources to justify their narratives.  ’ ’   French newspaper Le Monde  a list of the most   egregious examples of fake news, including one site, ”,” which deemed Marine Le Pen the   winner before any voting had actually taken place. (These   results, it said, were based on electronic ballots that had been   ”scanned in the USA, opposite the CIA headquarters. ”) ’ ’   The impact of this ”junk news” pushed by the    —   much of   it inspired or created by Russian disinformation  —   on the outcome   of the French elections will be difficult to measure. In an   encouraging sign, experts say that French citizens, on average,   have shared far fewer fake stories in the   to their   election than Americans did in the runup to theirs. ’ ’   Russian bots and trolls, meanwhile, are already shifting   their attention to another   European   election.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”France’s upcoming presidential. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’

                Second Powerful Earthquake Strikes Japan - The New York Times

                    TOKYO  —   A powerful earthquake and multiple aftershocks rattled the southwestern Japanese island of Kyushu on Saturday, killing at least 23 people, according to media reports, two days after another strong quake killed nine people on the same island. The largest of the new earthquakes had a magnitude of 7. 0, according to the United States Geological Survey, making it even more powerful than the  .2 quake on Thursday night. The Japan Meteorological Agency assessed the new quake at magnitude 7. 3. Saturday’s quake, which struck just before 1:30 a. m. toppled houses and apartment buildings, buckled roads and caused numerous landslides. Aftershocks shook the area throughout Saturday, more than 70 of them strong enough to cause damage to buildings, the Meteorological Agency reported. NHK, the national public broadcaster, said 23 deaths were confirmed Saturday as a result of the quake and the aftershocks, bringing the toll since Thursday to 32. Most of those killed were elderly some were trapped under collapsed buildings, while several died in fires and landslides in the mountainous region. Yoshihide Suga, the government’s chief cabinet secretary, said rescue units were working to free people from more than 50 collapsed buildings. About 900 people were treated for injuries, NHK reported. Thousands fled their homes and spent the night outdoors or in temporary shelters. Power failures left about 160, 000 homes without electricity, the news media reported, citing local electric utilities. About 90, 000 people had left their homes for shelters by Saturday evening, the authorities said. Television footage showed dark smoke rising from Mount Aso, a large volcano about 20 miles east of the town of Mashiki, where the epicenters of the strongest of the recent quakes have been clustered. Earthquakes and volcanic activity are closely associated, but the authorities said the eruption at Mount Aso, the biggest active volcano in Japan, was minor and did not pose an immediate threat. Sections of a stone wall, centuries old, around Kumamoto Castle collapsed into the castle’s moat on Saturday morning. The castle had already sustained damage in the earthquake on Thursday. Several buildings at Aso Shrine, an ancient Shinto shrine on the north slope of Mount Aso that is considered a national treasure, also collapsed. The Meteorological Agency classified the quake that set the disaster in motion on Thursday as a “foreshock” of the even larger one on Saturday. It warned that strong earthquakes could continue for days until the seismic fault line under the area settled. Heavy rain was expected in the area starting Saturday night, which would increase the risk of landslides. In the town of   east of Mashiki, landslides tore the moorings from a   suspension bridge, causing it to plunge into a valley, and buried more than a dozen homes, NHK said. Two students in a university agricultural program died after a dormitory building in the town collapsed, the network said. The government said it was sending units from the army, known in Japan as the   Forces, and from police departments around the country to help with rescue efforts. The earthquakes since Thursday have been concentrated along a cluster of fault lines that bisect the island of Kyushu at its center, from southwest to northeast. The island, somewhat larger than the state of Maryland, is home to 13 million people, though most of it is rural and sparsely populated. The quake Saturday was the strongest to strike Japan since a massive, 9.  offshore earthquake in 2011, which unleashed a tsunami that killed 18, 000 people in the country’s northeast and triggered meltdowns at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima. Kyushu is home to the only Japanese nuclear power station currently in operation, the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, about 75 miles southwest of Mashiki. Ground vibrations at Sendai were comparatively mild and were not threatening enough to trigger an automatic emergency shutdown, the Kyushu Electric Power Company said. The plant continued to operate normally on Saturday, the utility said.

                    ’  ’ ’State   Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed in a  Monday. ’ ’   ”This was not a decision that was taken lightly,” the statement   said. ’ ’   ”The US spared no effort in negotiating and attempting to   implement an arrangement with Russia aimed at reducing the   violence, providing unhindered humanitarian access, and degrading   terrorist organizations operating in Syria. ’ ’   ”Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments,”   the statement continued. ”Including its obligations under   international humanitarian law and UNSCR 2254.” ’ ’   UNSCR 2254 is the UN Security Council Resolution adopted in   December 2015 calling for a   and political settlement   in Syria. ’ ’   ”Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a   military course, inconsistent with the Cessation of Hostilities,   as demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian   areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals,   and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need,”   the statement said. ’ ’   Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the US   is trying to shift blame onto Russia by suspending the talks,   according to Reuters. ’ ”     Russian news agency RIA Novosti    that in response to the US move, Putin may order Russia’s   Duma to pass a bill that would allow Russia to maintain a   military presence in Syria indefinitely. ” ’  ’ ’   The formal suspension comes  US Secretary of State John Kerry first   threatened to cut off the negotiations.  ’ ’   Kerry told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in a phone call   last week that the US was preparing to ”suspend     bilateral engagement on Syria . .. unless Russia takes immediate   steps to end the assault on Aleppo” and restore a  . ’ ’   The State Department  about the call, saying ”the secretary made clear   the United States and its partners hold Russia responsible for   this situation, including the use of incendiary and bunker buster   bombs in an urban environment, a drastic escalation that puts   civilians at great risk.” ’ ’   Hundreds of people  in the worst bombings on the     eastern half of Aleppo since the war began in 2011. ’ ’  ’ ’   The bombings, which have also targeted rescue services in the   city, punctuated the collapse of a fragile   brokered   between the US and Russia earlier this month. ’ ’   On Friday, Lavrov told the BBC that the US  ”still, in spite   of many repeated promises and commitments. .. are not able or not   willing to” separate the moderate opposition they support with   former al Qaeda elements. ’ ’   ”We have more and more reasons to believe that from the very   beginning the plan was to spare Nusra and to keep it just in case   for Plan B or stage two when it would be time to change the   regime,” Lavrov said, referring to former   affiliate   Jabhat  . Nusra cut ties with the terror organization in   August and rebranded itself as  ’ ’ called the allegations ”absurd.” ’ ’  ’ ’   The   bilateral channel was part of a deal   between the US and Russia  in Syria and share   intelligence about terrorist positions. That deal had been   jeopardized by the latest   offensive on Aleppo,   however, with American and Russian diplomats exchanging   diplomatic jabs early last week. ’ ’   ”What Russia is sponsoring and doing is not counterterrorism  —   it   is barbarism,” Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United   Nations, told member nations at a UN Security Council meeting   last Sunday. ’ ’   Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by calling the language   ”unacceptable.” ’ ’   A Joint Implementation Center was being set up in Jordan,   where the US and Russia were set to coordinate their activities   in Syria. But all personnel who had been dispatched to the center   in anticipation of the   deal were going to be withdrawn. ’ ’   ”To ensure the safety of our respective military personnel and   enable the fight against Daesh, the US will continue to utilize   the channel of communications established with Russia to     counterterrorism operations in Syria,” Kirby said. ’ ’   The State Department’’s announcement came hours after Russian   President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on   cleaning up   plutonium over the US’’s ”unfriendly   acts.” ’

                     (CNN) Singer Ariana Grande had just performed her last song, ”Dangerous Woman,” to delighted fans, and the lights had just come on.  As the crowd began to move, many of them children wearing bunny ears like their idol, eyewitnesses at Monday’s concert at the Manchester Arena described a loud, sharp bang, and then chaos broke out.  ”Ariana had just finished her last song. We were getting ready to leave the arena and the next minute we heard a mighty bang coming from the   side of the arena,” Carole Long, who was at the concert with her    daughter Robin, told CNN. ”Everyone went crazy and was running and screaming and trying to get out and jumping over seats. How we weren’t crushed to death is amazing. People were just pushing and pushing and pushing. The stewards were screaming at people to get out.” Other witnesses say the sound of what police believe was an improvised explosive device    detonated by one man who was killed in the blast    was short and sharp like a gun shot, and then the air was filled with smoke. Twenty two people have been conformed dead, some of them children, and dozens others injured in the worst terror attack in Britain for 12 years.  The crowd was made up of mainly young people who had come to see Grande in her first of three scheduled concerts in the UK, on her European and Latin American tour.  READ MORE: What we know so far about attack, Abby Mullen, who had traveled down from Scotland for the gig, posted her recollection of the horrific attack on Facebook from her hotel room.   ”I thought we would leave seconds before the last song finished . .. to get home quicker instead of waiting longer for a taxi. As we were leaving a bomb or explosion went off meters in front of me” she wrote. ”Peoples skin, blood and faeces where (sic) everywhere including in my hair  on my bag. I’m still finding bits of god knows what in my hair.” Andy James had taken his    brother to what was his first ever pop concert. He said the explosion happened at around 10:40 p. m. as they were walking up the stairs to leave.  ”It must have been about 40 feet from where we were. We heard the explosion and the boom rattled in my chest. You could just feel it on the ground. ”We left to go in the opposite direction of where the explosion happened. There was a stampede of people, I was trying to help people up as we were leaving.  James said that as he ushered his little brother out, ”I had my hand on his chest and his heart was beating so fast.” ’Bodies scattered’ ”There was just bodies scattered about everywhere . .. it was just chaos,” Kiera Dawber told CNN. ”There was at least 20 or 30 people on the floor, some that you could see straight off were just . .. just dead.”  Dawber said she saw a man holding his wife. ”She wasn’t in a very good state,” Dawber said.  ”The injuries I saw . .. it didn’t look like the sort of injuries that people get from tripping over people in a hurry,” said Joel Goodman, a freelance photographer on the scene. Parents shouting out and yelling names, Ivo Delgado, another witness, recalled hearing one explosion before he saw people running.  ”It was more a moment of confusion, but still the bang was really great, really massive,” he said. ”I saw at least 3 people on the floor injured.” ”There was a lot of little girls running out, and parents shouting out and yelling names,” Delgado said. Sam Ward, who lives by the arena, said the loud bang sounded ”really nothing like I have ever heard in the city center before.” ”Initially after the first wave of sirens and the initial evacuation, it was filled with cars. The roads were actually bedlam. People actually going through red lights,” he said.  Search for the missing, Meanwhile the search goes on for those still missing, including Charlotte Campbell’s    daughter Olivia, who had gone to the concert with her friend Adam to celebrate his birthday.   Campbell had spoken to her daughter just before 10 p. m. but hasn’t heard from her since.  ”We’ve tried everything we can. They’re telling us to wait by the phones,” Campbell told CNN. ”Her dad is out looking . .. It’s the most horrible feeling ever, to know your daughter is there and you don’t know whether she’s dead or alive. ”I want her home and I want her safe . .. I just want her to walk through the door.” Her daughter has been registered as a missing person.

                    Paterson (Adam Driver) is a bus driver who lives in Paterson, New Jersey. He lives a sedate domestic life with his wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and their dog Marvin, an unflappable English bulldog. At work, he writes careful lines of poetry in a notebook when he gets home, he takes Marvin for a walk and stops at a local bar for one drink. It’s a prescribed existence, but not an unhappy one. In Jim Jarmusch’s new movie Paterson, there’s no major action day to day, but magic is constantly bleeding in from around the edges. Paterson is an extraordinarily humane film about the creative process, told on the smallest scale possible. It moves at the pace of life (in other words, slowly) but like all the best works of quiet realism, it builds narrative momentum as it goes on. It’s a portrait of a person’s daily routine that’s deeply felt and remarkably powerful, one where even mundane conversations can seem loaded with meaning. Jarmusch is the rare director who can actually ground the audience in a character’s point of view, letting you see through his or her eyes. As a result, Paterson emerges as a person who takes the world on its terms and delights in its details this is a film blessed with a similarly utopian outlook. Why Paterson, New Jersey, Is Famous in Lima, Peru, The magic of Paterson lies in its discovery of poetry on the margins and in the ordinary. Jarmusch’s last film Only Lovers Left Alive was another languid portrait of mundanity in a faded American city, but it concerned immortal vampires whiling away the time in Detroit. In that movie, Jarmusch was exploring the lives of jaded artists who are unmoved by every piece of art around them. Meanwhile, Paterson finds inspiration in the smallest things, like a box of matches or an overheard snippet of bar talk. If there’s any tension at all to the film, it’s in Paterson’s intense privacy. He’s   and   and lacks close friends outside of his wife and his local bartender Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley). He keeps his poetry, which he jots in notebooks on his lunch break, in his basement. Laura gently encourages him to share it with the world, but both she and the audience understand that’s not really the purpose of his writing. There’s something elemental to Paterson’s artistry that Jarmusch is trying to help the audience understand this is not a tale of a successful poet, but rather a celebration of that indefinable spark that exists in everyone, in some way or another. While Paterson writes poetry, Laura’s originality pours out of her in all sorts of ways, from her bizarre experiments with cooking to her penchant for decorating their house in different    patterns, each more oddly mismatched than the last. Doc is obsessed with chess, sharing his insights with Paterson whenever he stops by for a drink also at the bar is a constantly fighting couple (played by William Jackson Harper and Chasten Harmon) who demonstrate their furious passion for each other through heated arguments. On every bus ride, Jarmusch moves the camera away from Paterson, capturing bits of chatter between the other passengers, some of them nonsensical, but all of them weirdly fascinating. By steering clear of any grand plot, Jarmusch subtly forces viewers to pick up on the minutiae, to weigh each piece of dialogue carefully, to see things as Paterson does. There are magical little moments that seem somewhat otherworldly: Paterson runs into a strange number of twins in his journey around the city, and near the end of the movie has an encounter with a Japanese tourist that almost feels serendipitous. But these dreamlike elements aren’t bizarre omens —  they’re just reminders of the thrilling, unusual details that might strike anyone as interesting as they go about their day. Paterson is helped to greatness by its two fantastic leading performances. Farahani, an Iranian actress who shone in Asghar Farhadi’s 2009 drama About Elly, is a perfectly effervescent balance to Driver’s more muted work. Driver doesn’t play Paterson as simply stoic by confining so much of his emotion to his eyes and occasional smile, he manages to convey the act of thinking with grace. Paterson is a film about looking at our world through different, less distracted, more thoughtful eyes in the last year of cinema, there’s been almost nothing made with such a beautifully defined perspective.

                Republicans Begin Hashing Out Details of Convention Platform - The New York Times
            </div>

                    CLEVELAND  —   The Republican Party on Monday began debating what will become its 2016 platform. The draft that delegates will revise over the next two days will touch on a wide range of contentious issues  —   immigration, marriage, family values, criminal justice reform and policing. Some spots echoed the blunt,   style of the presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. Other spots seemed intended to serve as a softer, more welcoming alternative for the platform at the July   convention at Quicken Loans Arena. Some of the excerpts that were obtained by The New York Times: “The data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: that every child deserves a married mom and dad. The reality remains that millions of American families do not have the advantages that come with that structure. We honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all Americans should be treated with dignity and respect. But respect is not enough. Our laws and our government’s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society. For that reason, as explained elsewhere in the platform, we do not accept the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to states. ” “We emphatically support the original, authentic meaning of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. It affirmed that ‘No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination.’ . .. That same provision of the law is now being used by bureaucrats  —   and by the current president of the United States  —   to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the American people. Their agenda has nothing to do with individual rights it has everything to do with power. They are determined to reshape our schools  —   and our entire society  —   to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America’s history and traditions. Their edict to the states concerning restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities is at once illegal, ominous, and ignores privacy issues. We salute the several states which have filed suits against it. ” “Our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice. We welcome all to the Great Opportunity Party. . .. We both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues and support English as the nation’s official language. . .. With all our fellow citizens we have watched, in anger and disgust, the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation. We stand with the victims of his policies, especially the families of murdered innocents. Illegal immigration endangers everyone, exploits the taxpayers, and insults all who aspire to enter America illegally. . .. That is why we have in the past demanded, at our vulnerable borders, construction of a physical barrier and, at all ports of entry, maximum vigilance. . .. The Department of Homeland Security must use its authority to keep dangerous aliens off our streets and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens. Gang membership should be a deportable defense. ” ”The men and women of law enforcement  —   whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders, fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror  —   deserve our gratitude and our support. Their jobs are never easy, especially in crisis situations, and should not be made more difficult by political   from federal officials. The current administration’s lack of respect for them, from White House intervention in local arrests to the Attorney General’s present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country, has been unprecedented. . .. The power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state. We urge an immediate halt to the creation of new ‘crimes’ and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the Code and the body of regulation of old ‘crimes.’ We call for a mens rea defense to protect Americans who, in violating a law, act unknowingly or without criminal intent. ”

                Opinion: Time to end Israel’s impunity
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) Last summer, while visiting our family in Shuafat, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, my son Tariq was chased,   and beaten unconscious by Israeli police officers as he watched a protest. The protest was in response to the kidnapping and killing of his    friend and cousin, Muhammad Abu Khdeir, by Israeli settlers the day before. As the policemen lifted my unconscious son’s body away to prison, two officers continued to kick his limp body and face. In prison, he had to wait six hours before receiving medical attention. And we had to wait several months for him to be cleared of  wrongdoing in the case. When I first saw Tariq after the beating, I did not recognize him his face was badly bruised and his eyes were nearly swollen shut. I thought he was dead. I wanted to get closer to him, to see if he was breathing, to let him know I was there. But the hospital officials barred me from entering his room. I wish I could say what happened to Tariq is extremely unusual, but it’s not. Every year, somewhere between 500 and 700 Palestinian children are typically prosecuted in Israeli military courts, according to Defense for Children International Palestine. Human rights groups have documented abuse of these children and, in some cases, torture at the hands of Israeli soldiers, interrogators and policemen. Most likely you have never heard these stories. So why are you hearing about my son?  There are two main reasons. One is that Tariq is an American citizen, which has put our case in the international spotlight. The other is that his beating was caught on camera and posted online for the world to see. Although his savage beating has been viewed millions of times around the world, the police officers who beat Tariq have not been held accountable for the heinous crimes they committed. One officer was charged with the assault of a minor with the intent to cause injuries, but there were at least two other officers who actively participated in what I view as attempted murder. The name of the officer charged has not been released and there is no certainty that, despite being charged, he was actually convicted of anything. As Palestinians, we knew that the Israeli justice system was rigged against us. As U. S. citizens, we held out hope that in the aftermath of Tariq’s beating, the international scrutiny would pressure Israel to follow through on charges. We now fear that Tariq’s Palestinian roots will prevent him from ever receiving the justice owed to him. As a mother and as a human being who cannot stand to see children abused, I cannot let this go. That is why, this week, Tariq and I are traveling to Washington to speak at a congressional briefing as part of the No Way to Treat a Child campaign. We are asking the U. S. State Department to elevate the human rights of Palestinian children to a priority status in our bilateral relationship with Israel. We also call on Israeli authorities to adhere to international laws regarding the treatment of children that they have obligated themselves to implement, including the U. N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the U. N. Convention Against Torture. It is important to stress that these are only temporary safeguards and that, ultimately, the prolonged Israeli military occupation of Palestinian land must end and Palestinians must have equal rights for a just and lasting peace to take hold. Until then, ordinary people like me must continue to insist that our governments hold Israel accountable to international law in an effort to end the status quo of systemic impunity. The series of painful events that our family went through last summer have taken a toll on all our lives. After returning to Florida, where we live, I would look at my son’s face and wonder, did that beating cause brain damage? What sort of emotional scars will Tariq have to cope with for the rest of his life? What has been the impact of all this on his two younger sisters? What will become of our family in Jerusalem now that their American relatives are gone? The day we left, Tariq’s uncle and two cousins were detained by Israeli soldiers and held without charges. I can only assume they did so to try to silence us, to remind us that they are the occupiers, the ones in power. This horrifying cycle must be broken. The Israeli officers that tied my child up and beat him unconscious must be held accountable for what they did in a transparent manner. We must also ensure that this never happens again to any child, anywhere in the world. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .  Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine.

                Blue states should take Trump’s tax cut money and run
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) A few days after winning the presidency, Donald Trump visited Manhattan’s posh 21 Club and told the swells dining there, ”We’ll get your taxes down. Don’t worry about it.”  So far he seems intent on following through. Congressional Republicans are working on a   plan that in practice would benefit the   . And Trump’s pick of spending hawk Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Budget and Management suggests that government programs may indeed be slashed to make such tax cuts palatable to fiscal conservatives.   Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, ”should they?” and the answer is ”no.” The blue states should take the money and run.   The time has come for liberals to recognize that the Republican agenda    which they have little control over anyway    can work to their advantage. Who gets the least return on the money they send to Washington? The economically successful blue states. Which states most depend on federal spending?  The poorer red ones.   Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. Repealing Obamacare alone would deliver tax cuts totaling $346 billion over 10 years, every penny going to households making $200, 000 or more. Interesting that the 12 states with the largest percentage of such households all voted for Hillary Clinton.  No more universal health coverage?  Not necessarily. Massachusetts has Romneycare, a wildly popular   system that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act.  Insurers there expect little upheaval from an Obamacare repeal.   Massachusetts, by the way, has the strongest economy in the country, according to Governing magazine. California’s   insurance exchange is in good shape, notes Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.  California could simply adopt its own individual mandate as Obamacare does. Requiring everyone to buy coverage (or pay a fine) brings healthy people into the insurance pools. Having the young and hearty subsidize the sick and elderly keeps the pools stable. Connecticut, New York, Oregon and Washington are in especially good positions to do likewise, Bagley says. Trump’s choice of Scott Pruitt, a   denialist, to head the Environmental Protection Agency alarms environmentalists. So does Peter Navarro as head of a new White House trade council.  Navarro has accused NASA of ”politically correct environmental monitoring” of climate change through its   satellites.  No matter.  ”If Trump turns off the satellites, ” Gov. Jerry Brown said, ”California will launch its own damn satellite.” Given California’s lead in confronting climate change, we can well believe that Brown, who heads the world’s fifth biggest economy, would follow through on that promise.  You can bet that the work to build the satellites would almost all land in California.  In 2004, California set   standards higher than the federal government’s.  Twelve other states followed California’s lead and after an unsuccessful suit to stop the stricter standards, the auto industry came around.   In 2010, California required that 33% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. It was recently raised to 50% by 2030. Now 30 states have renewable energy requirements.  ”  ” is a   approach to cutting emissions of   greenhouse gases. When Congress failed to pass    legislation, California set up its own system. As of this writing, 10 states have done likewise.  This isn’t just environmental  . It is economic development. Almost 60% of all   venture capital in the United States ends up in California.  The federal income tax has been called a   tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What’s especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities.   Someone making $90, 000 in Houston would have to pull in $162, 000 to live as well in San Francisco, according to BankRate’s calculator.  Yet, all else being equal, the San Franciscan pays far more taxes to the federal government than the Houstonian. There’s no reason why   states can’t get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges.  And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home.

                The NFL’s protest crisis
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) The National Football League has a real crisis on its hands. No, this isn’t about concussions, domestic violence or even the ridiculously infamous ”Deflategate.” This is about the national anthem    whether to stand, kneel or raise a fist while giant American flags are being unfurled from end zone to end zone. The anthem crisis maybe isn’t an existential one    yet    to the NFL, but it has the potential to mushroom into something much bigger than being merely about Colin Kaepernick and a few other protesters. This crisis threatens to pit the league against its very own paying customers. You see, strangely, a league that has no compunction about fining players for wearing the wrong socks, shoes or twerking after a touchdown is suddenly silent about whether its employees must stand during the playing of the national anthem. ”The Shield” that would not allow players to commemorate slain police officers in Dallas has no firm policy on whether it’s OK or not if someone in an NFL uniform decides to chill during the singing of the   Banner. The NBA, generally considered the most   and progressive of the North American pro sports leagues, actually has a rule about the anthem, (and it’s pretty unequivocal): ”Players, coaches and trainers are to stand and line up in a dignified posture along the sidelines or on the foul line during the playing of the National Anthem.” And that goes for both the U. S. and Canadian anthems, since it has a team based in Toronto. But when Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers’ backup quarterback, decided that he would no longer honor the flag, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell limply made a statement saying the league merely ”encourages” players to be ”respectful” during the anthem, but there was no mention of requiring players to stand. If Kaepernick’s protest left the door ajar, Goodell’s response served to blow it from the hinges as a stampede of players decided to use the occasion to demonstrate whatever grievances they have against their own country. Kaepernick’s stated reason for his protest is that minorities in the U. S. are being oppressed. But more specifically, he claimed that he could not stand for the flag while the police are murdering civilians and getting away with it. He also displayed his disdain for law enforcement by wearing socks featuring pigs in police hats during practice (and so far appears to have received no discipline from the league for impermissible gear). Whether anyone agrees with Kaepernick’s sentiments, however, should be irrelevant to the NFL. This isn’t a free speech issue as many sympathetic to Kaepernick’s cause have claimed it to be. If Kaepernick made disparaging remarks toward gays, minorities or any ethnic group, he would’ve been fined   suspended. In fact, he was docked over $5, 000 by the league in 2014 for allegedly uttering the   during a game toward Lamarr Houston of the Chicago Bears (although he was later judged not to have used the slur). This isn’t about the First Amendment. While Congress shall make no law infringing on your freedom of expression, your employer damn well can impose what kind of conduct it expects when you’re on company time while wearing company gear. The NFL    just like the NBA    has every right to demand that its players stand erect and make no fuss while the national anthem is playing. By being derelict on this matter, though, Goodell risks his league alienating a healthy chunk of its paying customers    the fans and sponsors. The commissioner, already with an antagonistic relationship with the players and their union over what many see as his disciplinarian overreach, probably decided that he didn’t want to pick another fight. Maybe he wished that this whole anthem business would go away quickly, especially had the shaky Kaepernick been cut by the 49ers. But by suggesting that there are no rules, Goodell guaranteed that this issue would engulf his league    for the entire season and possibly beyond. And make no mistake, there’s already a strong racial undercurrent in this chasm    so far, the protesting football players are black, and the most visceral reaction toward the protesters has come from the league’s majority white fan base. The NFL has unwittingly allowed itself to become the biggest platform in America’s summer of discontent, pitting certain minority groups against the police and their supporters. What Goodell has done is not even condoned by some of the owners, who are ostensibly his bosses. And it is simply bad business. The NFL, already beset by problems with player safety and discipline, risks further erosion of its fan base, as reflected both in attendance and especially television ratings. What the   commissioner should have told his players is this: Protest all you want, but do it on your own time and dime.

                A home of their own after foster care
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Los Angeles (CNN) Georgie Smith was working as a designer and chef in Los Angeles when a young man named Barry sought her out.   He was 23 years old and living on his own after growing up in the foster care system. ”I went to see him living in his apartment, amongst black garbage bags,” Smith said. ”It was unacceptable. . .. I immediately thought of my nephew, who was around the same age, and I did what I would do for him.” Los Angeles County has the largest foster youth population in the country. At 18 to 21 years old, they age out of the system, often with no family, financial or community support. And the odds are stacked against them. Statistics show that many former foster youth will experience homelessness, poverty or incarceration along with higher rates of suicide, teen pregnancy and drug addiction.  ”They’re out on their own,” said Smith, 47. ”They finally get to that amazing place of having their own space, and then they’re sleeping on the floor.” In 2014, Smith gathered a team of volunteers, collected donated furniture and household items and transformed Barry’s makeshift living space into a real home.  That experience led Smith to start A Sense of Home. The nonprofit has since created comfortable living spaces for 130 young people who have aged out of the system. ”These kids have such resilience and are so inspiring. They are so incredibly positive and hopeful,” Smith said. ”I just feel it’s incumbent on us    the community    to be their village.” CNN’s Allie Torgan spoke with Smith about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.  CNN: You sort of stumbled into helping foster youth before you met Barry. How did that happen? Smith: Several years ago, my partner, Melissa, and I were looking into adoption. We happened to ask about the children that are taken away from their families    what about them? That’s when I discovered the foster system. And I was frankly appalled and wanted to get involved. We were so moved by the plight of foster youth that we began to volunteer (with) organizations that care for (them).  Barry found me through a design video posted on Facebook. It was miraculous how we transformed (his apartment). And this was such an easy, tangible way to make a difference. So I just kept doing it. It just snowballed. It seemed really clear to me that we as a community could share what we have too much of, give to these kids that have no family, no community and who are sleeping, eating and studying on the floor. CNN: How do you find the young people your group helps? Smith: We get referrals from agencies across L. A. County and surrounding counties. The youth must have a referral so we can establish that they truly were in the system. They also have to secure an apartment, enroll in college courses   be working 30 hours per week and have a GED or be studying for it. Obtaining the apartment is the most important factor. We meet them halfway. They have overcome so much to get to that place. Nearly all of them have experienced homelessness, and most, if not all, have experienced abuse. Eighty percent are young women 30% have their own babies. Many are guardians to their own siblings. CNN: The spaces you and your team create look like something out of a magazine. How does it all come together? Smith: We have an    staff who collect the donations, store it at the warehouse, organize what items we’re getting to them, load it onto the truck and then are there to coordinate the volunteers and help them get everything installed in the home. Every week we do a minimum of one home, outfitting their space with every conceivable item one needs to set up their   home    from soap to bedding and beds and curtains to fully stocking their kitchen with organic food. We provide them with tables and chairs and a desk on which to study.  Art is really important. So we try and find pieces that really reflect the aspirations of the youth so that they can look up and feel really inspired by the art on their walls. CNN: The work has become about more than just setting up furniture and walking away. Smith: All the youth come and pay it forward. They’ve got a community of former foster youth and the volunteers. When we do a home celebration, a housewarming, (it’s) a time for everyone to chill and hang out and break bread, to do spoken word, to tell their stories and share with the youth that are just receiving their home. It’s just amazing. They get to hang out and be together and network and find job opportunities and get mentors.  That foundation of home, which our family provides for us    they don’t have that. By setting up their first home, it gives them the foundation from which they can succeed. Want to get involved? Check out the A Sense of Home website and see how to help.

                EPA boss: Room for hope on climate change
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) If you’re concerned about climate change, you’re likely in full panic mode right now.  Consider three recent news items:  • US   Donald Trump has called climate change a ”hoax” and has suggested he might scrap many   environmental regulations, including the landmark Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius. • The head of Trump’s EPA transition team is basically a fossil fuel industry mouthpiece.   • And, thanks partly to our addiction to fossil fuels, this year is expected to be the hottest on record    again. That has real consequences all around the world, from Louisiana, where floods linked to   warming killed 13 people to India, where farmers were committing suicide amid searing drought Canada, where wildfires evacuated a city and Alaska, where the indigenous village of Shishmaref voted to relocate because the coast is melting.  Climate change is happening now. We’re causing it. And frankly, it’s terrifying.  But    and this is a critical ”but”    there’s still room for hope.  That’s the message I took from an interview Friday with the outgoing head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, who has been fighting climate change for the Obama administration.  ”Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, you’re going to care about the future for your kids,” she told me. ”Our clean energy train has left the station and it is filled with very happy people.  ”I’m pretty confident that we’ll be fine.” This from a woman who may be replaced with a climate change skeptic. I asked McCarthy a number of questions you sent in via Facebook and CNN’s Two Degrees newsletter. Many of you wanted to know how rapidly she expects Trump to shred   climate goals.  Those laws    including the Paris Agreement, the international treaty to slow warming, and the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to limit pollution from coal power    may not matter as much as you think, McCarthy said, since markets already are heading toward wind and solar and away from dirtier energy. ”I don’t think that anyone could think that getting rid of the (Clean Power Plan) or not joining the Paris Agreement (the US already joined it, actually, as have 114 others) is somehow going to change anything in the US,” she said. ”Investments are set. Five times as much investment in clean energy as there is in the rest of the economy.” ”The private sector is demanding it, businesses are demanding it,” she added.  ”I think 2. 5 million people depend on it for their jobs.”  Another ray of hope: Young people really care about this.  I relayed your questions about a federal court case in Oregon in which 21 young people are suing the federal government    including McCarthy    over relative inaction on climate change. The symbolism of the case is awesome: The kids argue on constitutional grounds that the government is failing to protect their right to property (one young plaintiff lives on the Florida coast, which is disappearing) and a livable future. Basically, they think young people are being discriminated against when it comes to climate. They have the most to lose    since they’ll live the longest, and see the most warming    yet they can’t vote. Advocates and attorneys for the kids want the Obama administration to settle the case now, before Trump takes office. They say the courts could force the Trump administration to curb   pollution.  A settlement is unlikely, McCarthy told me.  But she is encouraged young people are speaking up (even though she’s named in the suit).  ”Their voices need to be heard,” she said. ”It’s about their future.”  ”States can take action. Local communities can take action,” she said. ”People should not go back into their corners or be shy. And there’s no closet big enough to hold everybody who reads the climate science and understands it. We will still be able to make progress    (but) it may not be at the federal level.” To win on climate, Trump needs to see the business case, she said.  And realize the US could fall behind in the modern economy without action.  ”Are we going to be leading the worldwide effort or ceding that to another country, in particular China? Is that where we want to be?” she said. ”Or do we want to be in a leadership position where we’re making the jobs, we’re doing the innovation, we’re doing the investing, and frankly we’re standing up and doing what the science tells us we have to do.” The science, by the way, tells us we need to ditch fossil fuels    almost completely    this century. That’s to have any reasonable shot of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius above   levels, the threshold world leaders have agreed is the absolute red line for climate change.  It’s a harsh reality.  But, as climate activists are fond of saying, the Earth’s math doesn’t change because of politics.  We’ve already warmed the planet about 1 degree Celsius.  ”I’m hoping that this next administration will not have blinders on,” McCarthy said. The same could be said of the public.

                ‘Nothing Short of a Miracle’: No Serious Injuries in Tappan Zee Crane Collapse - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    In the ambitious business of New York bridge building, it has been a tragic consequence of the work: More than 20 people, including the bridge’s lead engineer, lost their lives during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. As workers raised the   Bridge in the 1960s, three people paid the ultimate price. And during construction of the original Tappan Zee Bridge in the 1950s, a worker fell to his death. But when a large crane being used to construct what will eventually be the aging Tappan Zee’s replacement came toppling down on Tuesday, landing squarely across the roadway, something astounding happened: Nobody died. “This was nothing short of a miracle,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at an afternoon news conference in Tarrytown at the base of the bridge, citing the lack of serious injuries from the accident. At least four people received minor injuries in the collapse, including three motorists who were trying to avoid the crane, officials said. A construction worker was also injured, officials said. The crane, one of 28 being used in the construction of the bridge’s $3. 9 billion  replacement  —   what is being called the largest infrastructure project in the country  —   fell around noon on the Rockland County side of the bridge, the authorities said. No vehicles were struck by the crane, the authorities said. Irving Martinez, a truck driver from New Haven, was heading home after delivering a load of cars in Blauvelt, N. Y. when, from about a quarter of a mile away, he saw the crane list and topple. “The crane was rotating normally and then it just suddenly fell sideways onto the highway,” Mr. Martinez, 25, said. “It was out of nowhere. ” While most drivers hit the brakes, he said, others accelerated to avoid the crash. “You know New Yorkers,” he quipped. “Always in a hurry. ” Aerial images showed the crane draped across all lanes of the bridge, its frame splintered into pieces as traffic was brought to a standstill. With the bridge blocked, many motorists were stranded for several hours. Some took to social media to document the travail. The collapse raised concerns about the integrity of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the state’s longest, which is used by 138, 000 vehicles traveling between Rockland and Westchester Counties on weekdays. Built on the cheap, it was designed to last for only 50 years. And it also snarled traffic along the New York State Thruway, which traverses the bridge, and feeder roads. Traffic was blocked on Interstate 287 heading west toward Rockland at least as far as the Sprain Brook Parkway exit, as well as on the Thruway heading east toward Westchester. The Tappan Zee Express Bus Service, which transports commuters between Westchester and Rockland, was suspended, as officials rearranged transit schedules and other road availabilities. But after officials inspected the bridge, they gradually reopened all of its lanes except for one southbound lane. Mr. Cuomo described the damage to that lane as significant but not extensive, saying it could take days to repair. Officials said the crane, which was new, was engaged in a routine task  —   wielding a vibratory hammer to install pilings. “This was not one of the   operations of bridge building,” Mr. Cuomo said. Jeff J. Loughlin, the business manager of International Union of Operating Engineers Local 137, which represents the crane’s operator, said the crane was an MLC 300 manufactured by Manitowoc Cranes. An official said the crane’s boom was 256 feet long. Mr. Loughlin said the operator remained at the scene with a union representative, and was expected to undergo drug and alcohol testing. “It’s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom,” Mr. Loughlin said. Officials said they were investigating the cause of the crane’s crash. But they ruled out the wind. There have been no deaths or serious injuries involving bridge workers since construction began on the new Tappan Zee Bridge in 2013. Mr. Cuomo said that the project’s track record had been extraordinary for an undertaking of its size but noted that “things happen. ” “Somebody will drop a hammer,” he said. While Mr. Cuomo said that four people were injured in Tuesday’s accident, Ed Day, the Rockland County executive, said that five people suffered minor injuries. The crane’s collapse drew new focus to the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. The bridge, which is being built just north of the old bridge and is scheduled to be completed in 2018, has been mentioned by Mr. Cuomo as well as President Obama as an exemplary infrastructure project. On Monday during an event in Brooklyn, Mr. Cuomo praised the process used to contract the bridge’s construction out to private companies. But Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday afternoon that the accident did not jeopardize the new bridge’s construction or its time frame for completion. He said it was a lucky break that the crane fell in the middle of the day when traffic was lighter. Victor Fargas, 57, a glass worker from the Bronx who had to delay some of his jobs after getting stuck in the traffic, decided to pass the time by taking a nap in his truck. “Now I’m doing all I can do,” he said, “patiently waiting and praying to the traffic gods. ”

                What we know about Hillary Clinton’s health

                     (CNN) As Hillary Clinton fell ill during a   commemoration ceremony Sunday morning and revealed that she had pneumonia, Democrats and Republicans alike raised questions of concern about her health. Now, Clinton’s campaign has released a new doctor’s letter that provides an overview of her health records, which reveal that her health has somewhat remained stable since her records were divulged last year.  ”We have a little bit more detail about this most recent episode with pneumonia. We understand now that she had some symptoms for some time,” said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN’s chief medical correspondent and a practicing neurosurgeon.  ”When I look at these types of letters, I’m looking for things that are big. Is there any underlying illness?” Gupta said of the letter. ”I wouldn’t say that there’s anything that’s abnormal in here.” The Democratic presidential nominee left the commemoration ceremony early, after an hour and a half, when she started to feel ”overheated,” campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. She took some time to recover, about an hour and 45 minutes, at her daughter’s apartment. When she   about noon, she waved to   and told reporters she was feeling ”great.” The incident occurred just days after Republicans argued that moments when Clinton coughed along the campaign trail were signs of a more serious health issue. Her campaign said she suffered from seasonal allergies. ”My overall impression is that Mrs. Clinton has remained healthy and has not developed new medical conditions this year other than a sinus and ear infection and her recently diagnosed pneumonia. She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States,” Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in the new letter. From seasonal pollen allergies to hypothyroidism, here’s what we know about the    presidential candidate’s health. Clinton’s blood clots, Clinton’s current bout with pneumonia does not negate the fact that as secretary of state, she withstood an extensive travel schedule and maintained good health. In a report that was released in July 2015 (PDF) Bardack wrote, ”Mrs. Clinton is a healthy    female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. Her past medical history is notable for a deep vein thrombosis in 1998 and in 2009, an elbow fracture in 2009 and a concussion in 2012. . ..” ”She participates in a healthy lifestyle and has had a full medical evaluation, which reveals no evidence of additional medical issues or cardiovascular disease. Her cancer screening evaluations are all negative. She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.” Clinton was advised in 1998 to take   medications to prevent deep vein thrombosis blood clots when she traveled on   flights, Bardack wrote. Blood clots can be a serious health risk for travelers, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They can form in the deep veins of the legs when a person sits still for an extended period, such as during long flights. The problem turns serious if the blood clot breaks off and travels to other parts of the body, such as the lungs. Along with taking   medication, Clinton takes medication for hypothyroidism, a condition in which her thyroid gland is underactive and doesn’t produce enough important hormones, according to Bardack’s report. The report also indicated that, in a physical exam on March 21, 2015, Clinton’s vital signs appeared ”healthy,” with a blood pressure of   heart rate of 72, respiratory rate of 18 and temperature of 98. 7. The remainder of her exam was normal. In the new letter, Clinton’s vital signs showed blood pressure of   heart rate of 70, respiratory rate of 18, temperature of 97. 8 and   of 99%.  Clinton’s bones and brain, Clinton’s health history also includes a bone fracture. She stumbled at the State Department in summer 2009 and fractured her right elbow. The injury resulted in her having to undergo a   surgery, which was deemed successful.  Then, in December 2012, Clinton suffered a stomach virus after traveling and fainted, which caused her to suffer a concussion, according to Bardack’s report. In   evaluations, she was found to have a transverse sinus venous thrombosis    in other words, a blood clot in the brain. The clot later dissolved. A concussion is a brain injury, explained Gupta. ”What we’ve heard from her medical note is, looking at the   there would be some concern, but she’s been tested, and there’s no   impact from her brain, and the blood clot has resolved,” he said. Gupta added that it is difficult to comment on Clinton’s health without additional information. ”This diagnosis of pneumonia came in on Friday,” he said. ”It’s a totally treatable thing, there’s no question about it, but it’s a serious diagnosis still and is something that should not be taken lightly.” The Donald Trump campaign hadn’t commented on Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as of Sunday evening. Trump himself has released minimal information about his health. Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump’s personal physician, released a letter (PDF) in December that lacked much medical detail but noted that Trump would be ”the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Gupta found such language in the letter to be surprising and ”almost comically” lacking objectivity.

                What Is Immunotherapy? The Basics on These Cancer Treatments - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Some of the most promising advances in cancer research in recent years involve treatments known as immunotherapy. These advances are spurring billions of dollars in investment by drug companies, and are leading to hundreds of clinical trials. Here are answers to some basic questions about this complex and rapidly evolving field. Immunotherapy refers to any treatment that uses the immune system to fight diseases, including cancer. Unlike chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells, immunotherapy acts on the cells of the immune system, to help them attack the cancer. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors are the most widely used form of immunotherapy for cancer. They block a mechanism that cancer cells use to shut down the immune system. This frees killer    —   a critically important part of the immune system  —   to attack the tumor. Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are on the market. They are given intravenously. Another form of immunotherapy, called cell therapy, involves removing immune cells from the patient, altering them genetically to help them fight cancer, then multiplying them in the laboratory and dripping them, like a transfusion, back into the patient. This type of treatment is manufactured individually for each patient, and is still experimental. Bispecific antibodies are an alternative to cell therapy, one that does not require individualizing treatment for each patient. These antibodies are proteins that can attach to both a cancer cell and a   that way bringing them close together so the   can attack the cancer. One such drug, called Blincyto, has been approved to treat a rare type of leukemia. Vaccines, another form of immunotherapy, have had considerably less success than the others. Unlike childhood vaccines, which are aimed at preventing diseases like measles and mumps, cancer vaccines are aimed at treating the disease once the person has it. The idea is to prompt the immune system to attack the cancer by presenting it with some piece of the cancer. The only vaccine approved specifically to treat cancer in the United States is Provenge, for prostate cancer. Another vaccine, BCG, which was developed to prevent tuberculosis, has long been used to treat bladder cancer. As a weakened TB bacterium, BCG appears to provoke a general immune system reaction that then works against the cancer. Researchers hope that other vaccines may yet be made to work by combining them with checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved to treat advanced melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cancers of the lung, kidney, bladder and head and neck. The drugs are being tested in many other types of cancer. So far, cell therapy has been used mostly for blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. The four on the market are: Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) made by   Squibb Keytruda (pembrolizumab) by Merck and Tecentriq (atezolizumab) by Genentech. Though immunotherapy has been stunningly successful in some cases, it still works in only a minority of patients. Generally, 20 percent to 40 percent of patients are helped by checkpoint inhibitors  —   although the rate can be higher among those with melanoma. Some patients with advanced disease have had remissions that have lasted for years. In some cases, combining two checkpoint inhibitors increases the effectiveness. But for some people the drugs do not work at all, or they help just temporarily. Cell therapy can produce complete remissions in 25 percent to 90 percent of patients with lymphoma or leukemia, depending on the type of cancer. In some cases the remissions can last for years, but in others relapses occur within a year. Checkpoint inhibitors can cause severe problems that are, essentially, autoimmune illnesses, in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue as well as cancer. One result is inflammation. In the lungs it can cause breathing trouble in the intestine it can cause diarrhea. Joint and muscle pain, and rheumatoid arthritis can also occur, and the immune system can also attack vital glands like the thyroid and pituitary. In rare cases, the immune system can attack the heart, especially when patients take two checkpoint inhibitors at the same time. These reactions are dangerous, but can often be controlled with steroid medicines like prednisone and other   drugs. Cell therapy can also lead to severe and potentially fatal reactions resulting from the overstimulation of the immune system. The reactions can usually be controlled, but patients may need to be treated in an intensive care unit. Checkpoint inhibitors can cost $150, 000 a year. Many insurers will pay if the drug has been approved for the type of cancer the patient has. But sometimes there are high  . Patients in clinical trials may get the drugs free. Manufacturers have not said yet how much they will charge for cell therapies, assuming they win approval and reach the market. But experts expect the price to be as high as a few hundred thousand dollars. Any oncologist can prescribe the checkpoint inhibitors that are on the market. Patients with cancers for which the drugs have not been approved may find insurers reluctant to pay, but may be able to get the drugs for free by volunteering for clinical trials. Cell therapies are available only through clinical trials now. Most of the study sites are major medical centers. Information is available on the Cancer Research Institute website, or by calling     (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a. m. to 6 p. m. E. T.). Another source is ClinicalTrials. gov.

                What can be done to stop deadly floods? (Opinion)
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                     (CNN) The deadly rainfall that has left many parts of Houston underwater has happened before and can happen again    not only in Texas but other cities that are unprepared. Houston has been known to flood even in moderately heavy rains    some of its roads are designed to collect large pools of water when the city’s drainage gets overwhelmed, which happens pretty often. And some parts of the city received an enormous amount of rain    more than 11 inches. Houston is a pretty flat city in a subtropical climate just barely above sea level. Under those circumstances, realistically flooding may be unavoidable, even though the city is taking steps through its RebuildHouston initiative to improve the drainage system and address problem flooding areas. But the fact remains that in some cities even just a few inches of rain can result in flooded basements and   roads. Why? Because the way we have built cities makes them flood. When we pave over absorbent dirt and grasses, rainwater runs off asphalt and concrete and often ends up overwhelming drainage systems and, in severe cases, flooding homes. The more impervious surfaces a city has, the more likely it is that it will suffer from urban flooding. Sprawling, heavily paved cities such as Houston can be especially vulnerable. The Center for Neighborhood Technology analyzed National Weather Service data in 10 major cities across the United States, including Houston’s Harris County. We found that the residents in the county faced 145 flood warnings and alerts between 2007 and 2011    that’s one every 12 days. Our research has also determined that flooding can happen in areas that are least expected    for example, our study of urban flooding in Cook County, Illinois, home to Chicago, analyzed data on insurance payouts for flood damage from 2007 to 2011 and found that 97% of Cook County’s ZIP codes experienced flooding, even if they were far from designated flood plains. Indeed some of the ZIP codes with the highest payouts had no flood plains in them at all. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of rainstorms in much of the country. According to the federal U. S. Global Change Research Program, the type of heavy rainstorms that currently occur once every 20 years could happen at least twice as often in Southern states such as Texas if an aggressive emissions reduction program isn’t implemented. In other parts of the country, these storms could become up to seven times more frequent. Severe storms that now happen every 20 years could come every four years by 2100. As the threat of climate change escalates, cities and regions must get serious about finding solutions. Our priority is to identify those solutions that bring quick relief to   homes, are affordable and effective: This requires a coordinated program of investment across private and public property, to help upgrade homes and streets to make them resilient to wet weather events.   The Center for Neighborhood Technology created its RainReady program as a   initiative designed to bring communities together to find solutions to the problems of too much or too little water. We’ve brought together property owners, municipal officials and stormwater drainage experts to identify a community’s   drainage issues and determine the best set of strategies for minimizing property, yard and street flooding and the damage that comes with it.  Investments in natural and   infrastructure to increase infiltration and collect rain where it falls, also known as green infrastructure, play a strong role in the RainReady program. Green infrastructure can, in some applications, be a more   approach than conventional stormwater infrastructure, and it can provide a whole set of benefits that ”gray infrastructure” does not, including improved water and air quality, groundwater recharge, reduced stormwater runoff volume, additional wildlife habitat and recreational space and increased land values.  Coordinated landscaping, plumbing and building improvements for properties include backwater valves, downspout disconnection into dry wells and flood walls runoff from alleys and parking lots can be captured through the installation of permeable pavement, trees and landscaped sidewalks temporary water storage can be created from ponds, parks, urban forests and wetlands and rain sensor networks can provide enhanced monitoring and flood alert systems for communities.     Building a resilient future needs to start now. Legislation such as the Urban Flooding Awareness Act, passed in Illinois last summer and currently being introduced at the federal level by Rep. Mike Quigley,   and Sen. Dick Durbin,   is an important first step in assessing the scope of the problem. To avoid flooding devastation takes planning and foresight but also constant monitoring. The fact of the matter is, once a heavy rainstorm hits, there’s little a city can do to prevent flooding. Most preventative measures must be in place in preparation for these storms, because when the skies open up, all we can do is watch and learn where flooding is happening. Residents can play an important role in this monitoring by reporting pools of water hanging around long after the rains have gone to their municipalities. While flooding may not be entirely preventable, that doesn’t mean it has to be catastrophic. There are lessons we can learn from Houston and steps we should be taking to prepare for and mitigate devastating impacts that the coming rainstorms can bring.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

                Stephen Bannon and Breitbart News, in Their Words - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    The appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as chief White House strategist for   Donald J. Trump has been condemned by civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans, because of Mr. Bannon’s record as chairman of Breitbart News, the   news and opinion site. Here, in his own words, are a selection of Mr. Bannon’s public statements about the country, the Republican Party and his own political philosophy. • “Fear is a good thing. Fear is going to lead you to take action,” he said in a 2010 interview. • Referring to Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin in a 2011 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio, he said: “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative. That’s why there are some unintended consequences of the women’s liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn’t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane, and that’s why they hate these women. ” • Mr. Bannon made a movie in 2012 about the Occupy Wall Street protests. He told an interviewer: “After making the Occupy movie, when you finish watching the film, you want to take a hot shower. You want to go home and shower because you’ve just spent an hour and 15 minutes with the greasiest, dirtiest people you will ever see. ” • “I think anger is a good thing,” he told a gathering of conservatives in Washington in 2013, according to a profile in The Atlantic. “This country is in a crisis. And if you’re fighting to save this country, if you’re fighting to take this country back, it’s not going to be sunshine and patriots. It’s going to be people who want to fight. ” • “I’m a Leninist,” Mr. Bannon was quoted as saying by a writer for The Daily Beast who met him at a party in 2014. He later said he did not recall the conversation. “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal, too,” the site quoted him as saying. “I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment. ” • “What we need to do is   the Republican Party,” he said in a 2010 radio interview on Political Vindication Radio. • “We don’t believe there is a functional conservative party in this country, and we certainly don’t think the Republican Party is that,” he told the same gathering. “It’s going to be an insurgent,   populist movement that is virulently   and it’s going to continue to hammer this city, both the progressive left and the institutional Republican Party. ” • “There is a growing global   revolt against the permanent political class at home, and the global elites that influence them, which impacts everyone from Lubbock, Tex. to London, England,” he said in a 2014 interview in The New York Times. •“Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that’s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty,” he wrote about Republican leaders in a 2014 email exchange with a Breitbart News editor. The emails were obtained by The Daily Beast. • “We call ourselves ‘the Fight Club.’ You don’t come to us for warm and fuzzy,” Mr. Bannon told The Washington Post this year. “We think of ourselves as virulently   particularly ‘ ’ the permanent political class. We say Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. ” Mr. Bannon  took over Breitbart News in 2012 after the death of its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and shifted it further to the right. Critics, including some conservatives formerly associated with it, have denounced Breitbart in its current incarnation as a hate site steeped in misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, white nationalism and  . Here is a sampling of some articles published during Mr. Bannon’s tenure that drew criticism: • “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy” A December 2015 article by Milo Yiannopoulos, who was later barred from Twitter when he was accused of inciting racist and sexist attacks on the actress Leslie Jones, told women that birth control “makes you fat,” “makes your voice unsexy,” “makes you jiggle wrong,” “makes you a slut” and “makes you unsexy all the time. ” • “Bill Kristol: Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew” A May 2016 article by David Horowitz criticized Bill Kristol for his opposition to Mr. Trump as “a political miscalculation so great and a betrayal so profound as to not be easily forgiven. ” • “World Health Organization Report: Trannies 49 Xs Higher HIV Rate” A December 2015 article by Austin Ruse, using a slur for transgender people in the headline, argued that a public health study on sexual health in the transgender community was actually a warning about “how dangerous it is to become ‘transgender. ’” The site called it a rebuke to “the ‘transgender’ narrative that is sweeping American culture. ” • “Roger Stone: Huma Abedin ‘Most Likely a Saudi Spy’ With ‘Deep, Inarguable Connections’ to ‘Global Terrorist Entity’” A June 2016 article by Dan Riehl chronicled the belief of Mr. Stone, a Trump adviser, that Ms. Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, was connected to a terrorist conspiracy. • “There’s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews” A July 2016 article by Mr. Yiannopoulos argued that it was women’s fault that tech firms hired so few of them. • “Lesbian Bridezillas Bully Bridal Shop Owner Over Religious Beliefs” An August 2014 article by Susan Berry criticized a lesbian couple who complained on Facebook about a Pennsylvania bridal shop that refused to sell them wedding dresses. • “The Solution to Online ‘Harassment’ Is Simple: Women Should Log Off” A July 2016 article by Mr. Yiannopoulos argued that women were “screwing up the internet for men by invading every space we have online and ruining it with   and a needy, demanding,   form of modern feminism. ”

                Magnus Carlsen Overwhelms Challenger in Tiebreakers to Win World Chess Championship - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    It took nearly three weeks, 12 closely fought games and a day of   tiebreakers to decide the World Chess Championship, but at the end of play on Wednesday, victory went to Magnus Carlsen, the Norwegian grandmaster, leaving Sergey Karjakin to return home to Russia in noble defeat. “Karjakin only wanted to prove he was Carlsen’s equal,” said Denes Boros, a Hungarian grandmaster and chess commentator who was at the event. “Carlsen came to prove he was greater. ” In the end, he was. Wednesday was Mr. Carlsen’s 26th birthday, which he said earlier in the week had been good luck in the past. Mr. Karjakin is also 26, making them the youngest pair ever to face off in the world championship. Spectators at the Fulton Market Building in Lower Manhattan, many of them students of past championships, declared the match outstanding, with each player pressing minute advantages or finding inventive defenses against whatever attack the other threw at him. “It’s one of the   matches on both sides,” said Lev Alburt, a grandmaster who has followed championship matches since 1954. “Even the fact of many draws, almost all have been achieved in very sharp play. Both players are trying to squeeze something almost from nothing. Where other players would play safe, both keep playing for a win, creating problems for their opponent at a risk to themselves. ” “It’s one of the most exciting championship matches in history,” he said. “If you’re a beginner, you can learn a lot, and if you’re a grandmaster, you can learn a lot. ” Everything got fast and fun on Wednesday, as the solemn, deliberative pace of the first 12 games gave way to rapid action in which mistakes were inevitable. The tiebreakers consisted of four games of   chess, with each man given 25 minutes to complete his moves, plus an additional 10 seconds for every move made. After Peter Thiel, the billionaire entrepreneur and former chess prodigy, made the ceremonial first move, Mr. Karjakin, playing white, began the day like most others, with the Ruy Lopez opening. Both players started aggressively, with Mr. Carlsen advancing his pawns on the queen side. He stood up from the board twice in the opening minutes. Mr. Karjakin pushed back, but after an exchange of major pieces, the game headed to a draw  —   a slight advantage for Mr. Carlsen, who now had white for two of the remaining three games. In the next game, with the rain outside wrapping the venue in a gauzy gray, Mr. Carlsen put enormous time pressure on Mr. Karjakin, at one point forcing the Russian’s clock down to near zero. But a combination of creative defense and missed opportunities let Mr. Karjakin escape with a stalemate, eliciting applause from the crowd. “Magnus blew it,” said Maurice Ashley, a grandmaster watching in a V. I. P. area. Then in Game 3, first blood. With Mr. Karjakin again playing white, Mr. Carlsen applied unrelenting pressure on both sides of the board, forcing Mr. Karjakin again to use his clock. This time the challenger did not have a response for Mr. Carlsen’s attack, and they entered the last game with Mr. Karjakin needing a win just to stay alive and force the match into the blitz round. Mr. Carlsen, playing white in Game 4, never gave Mr. Karjakin a chance, opening a slight advantage and pressing it until the challenger had to fight not to lose. This time, Mr. Karjakin’s remarkable ability to eke out draws was of no use. Mr. Carlsen, needing only a draw to win the match, pressed on and won. For Mr. Carlsen, who has been called “the Mozart of chess,” the last two games were a   recovery from his mistake in Game 2, which allowed his opponent to escape. After defending brilliantly throughout the match, Mr. Karjakin never managed a serious attack in the tiebreakers. With just three wins in 16 games, Mr. Carlsen retained his title and his reputation as a player with no weaknesses. This was the first world championship match in New York since 1995, and organizers hoped to emulate the luxury boxes at baseball or basketball games, with a V. I. P. lounge where drinks were free and tickets cost up to $1, 200 a day. Regular day passes cost $75 most days. It was a test for chess as an American spectator sport, and the results were mixed. Even in the venue, most spectators followed the game on video monitors or computer simulations of the board, rather than observing the players through the   mirrors. Many played their own games as the action was going on. Yet the energy of the crowd at moments was unmistakable, if never exactly at the level of Alabama versus Clemson. The organizers said 10 million people worldwide followed the match online  —   some paying $15 and up for   video, but most watching computer renderings of the board and pieces for free. The winner takes home 60 percent of a prize purse of about $1. 1 million, lower than at some previous championships. Bruce Pandolfini, a writer and teacher, said that history was being made, in part because of the players’ youth and Mr. Carlsen’s celebrity, and also because the match was accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Both players are young enough to build a rivalry for years to come, though three Americans  —   Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So and Hikaru Nakamura  —   were all rated higher than Mr. Karjakin going into the match and are eager for a shot at the title in 2018. If one of them gets that far, he will be the first American to compete for the championship since Bobby Fischer won it in 1972. After the game, Mr. Karjakin suggested that he might have   at the expense of his creativity. “Maybe it would be better to have a fresh head and not repeat so much,” he said. Mr. Carlsen said it was the most difficult of his championship matches, adding, “I’m very happy that at the end of the match I managed to find joy in playing. ” He added, “That’s the most important thing. ”

                Review: In Don DeLillo’s ‘Zero K,’ Daring to Outwit Death - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Death stalks Don DeLillo’s characters  —   be it in the form of terrorism, the atomic bomb, assassination, suicide, war, earthquakes, murderous cults or “an airborne toxic event” passing over the landscape “like some death ship in a Norse legend. ” To try to stave off their fear of death, his people compulsively reach for belief systems, drugs, hobbies, organizing principles (from football to mathematical equations to stories) housekeeping rituals  —   anything that might hold the inevitable fact of mortality at bay. “All plots tend to move deathward,” the narrator of “White Noise” says. “This is the nature of plots. Political plots, terrorist plots, lovers’ plots, narrative plots, plots that are part of children’s games. We edge nearer death every time we plot. It is like a contract that all must sign, the plotters as well as those who are the targets of the plot. ” Mr. DeLillo’s haunting new novel, “Zero K”  —   his most persuasive since his astonishing 1997 masterpiece, “Underworld”  —   is a kind of bookend to “White Noise” (1985): somber and coolly futuristic, where that earlier book was satirical and darkly comic. In “Zero K,” two central characters seek to conquer death not by outrunning it but by submitting to it: They plan to be “chemically induced to expire” and frozen at a supersecret cryonics compound so that one day they might be resurrected  —   through a     science involving cellular regeneration and nanotechnology. One day, humans (at least rich ones) will have the option of being reborn as new and improved beings implanted with memories of their choice  —   music, family photographs, philosophical writings, “Russian novels, the films of Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky. ” “Zero K” gets off to a stilted start  —   with unfortunate echoes of Mr. DeLillo’s recent novels “Point Omega” (2010) “Falling Man” (2007) and “Cosmopolis” (2003) which exchanged his jazzy, tactile feel for contemporary life for strangely stylized, almost abstract musings on identity and fate. A third or so of the way in, however, this new novel kicks into gear as Mr. DeLillo begins to actively use his radar for the incongruities and chimeras of modern life. His story gradually opens outward to examine the ways science and religion have come to clash and converge in a world fearful of terrorism and war and eager to look to technology for solutions, even salvation. At the same time, “Zero K” opens inward to draw a portrait of the narrator Jeffrey’s emotionally fraught relationship with his chilly and controlling father  —   reminiscent of Nick Shay’s filial relationship in “Underworld,” one of the few DeLillo novels to delve beneath the brittle surface of its characters’ lives. At the beginning of “Zero K” Jeffrey is whisked off to a remote compound somewhere vaguely near Kazakhstan, where his billionaire father, Ross, has funded the Convergence project, which freezes and preserves the dead in anticipation of the day when both mind and body can be restored. A special unit called Zero K is for patients who make a conscious decision to “transition to the next level” before their natural deaths. Ross’s beloved wife, Artis, who has several disabling illnesses, has opted for this form of assisted suicide, and Ross, who is perfectly healthy, announces that he intends to accompany Artis on her journey into the afterlife. Jeffrey is understandably perturbed, wondering if his father has been brainwashed into some kind of dangerous cult, or whether his decision is a perverse manifestation, as an immensely wealthy man, of wanting to exert control over his life  —   in this case, by choosing to end it. He realizes that his reaction is complicated by his ambivalent feelings toward his father, who, decades ago, abandoned him and his mother. And that his own alienation (that state of mind shared by so many DeLillo protagonists) has roots in this Oedipal conflict. Mr. DeLillo’s depiction of the Convergence compound will trigger all sorts of associations for the reader. There are labyrinthine hallways with inaccessible rooms behind mysterious doors, reminiscent of those portals that Lewis Carroll’s Alice had difficulty entering in Wonderland. There are also odd, Kafkaesque exchanges with Convergence escorts who speak a New Agey bureaucratese that masks their sinister work and    glimpses of Artis and other patients being groomed for the next stage of their journeys, when their bodies will be placed in superinsulated pods (their brains and other vital organs having already been harvested for separate preservation, like those of Egyptian mummies). If there are echoes in these pages of Stanley Kubrick’s classic 1968 movie, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Mr. DeLillo’s vision turns out to be considerably darker. He is skeptical of those who might regard human life as a step on an evolutionary ladder between the apes and a futuristic race of star children. In fact, “Zero K” suggests that the hope that technology will supply a solution to the problem of mortality (as religion once did) is both delusional and a dangerous distraction from the here and now. Film footage of natural and   catastrophes play on screens at the Convergence, and its robotlike employees seem to welcome the impending   as a new beginning. All the themes that have animated Mr. DeLillo’s novels over the years are threaded through “Zero K”  —   from the seduction of technology and mass media to the power of money and the fear of chaos. This novel does not possess  —   or aspire toward  —   the symphonic sweep of “Underworld” it’s more like a chamber music piece. But once the novel shakes off its labored start, “Zero K” reminds us of Mr. DeLillo’s almost   powers as a writer and his understanding of the strange, contorted shapes that eternal human concerns (with mortality and time) can take in the new millennium.

                At raucous town hall, GOP congressman confronts anger about Trump 
            </div>

                    Aurora, Colorado (CNN) Republican Rep. Mike Coffman faced angry constituents at a town hall Wednesday night, in an early sign of the political price he and his colleagues might pay for supporting President Donald Trump’s policies, including the repeal of Obamacare. A moderate hailing from a swing district, Coffman fielded more than 40 questions from Coloradans for almost two hours. Health care overwhelmingly dominated the at times raucous evening, as the congressman’s constituents demanded to know why he backed a bill to gut Obamacare before it was yanked from the House floor. More than once, Coffman was offered an ultimatum: You can side with us or side with the President. One woman who described herself as a health care worker with   conditions said the health care bill that Trump endorsed would eliminate protections for people with medical histories. ”Are you going to side with Trump or are you going to . .. stand with your constituents?” the woman wanted to know. Coffman vowed to protect coverage for those with   conditiseons, and also insisted that he disagreed with Trump’s suggestion of letting Obamacare ”implode.” ”I don’t think that’s right. Somehow he thinks that the Democrats are going to come around if it implodes,” he said. ”I think we need to fix it. And we need to fix it now.” For most of the evening, Coffman appeared to take the frequent ”booing” in good humor. But as the town hall approached the   mark, the criticisms    and in particular, the repeated suggestion that he wasn’t holding Trump accountable on everything from his tax returns to potential business conflicts    clearly exasperated the congressman. The tensions came to a head with the final question of the evening, from a woman who said her   had died in Auschwitz. She expressed dismay at what she said was a ”president who has   people” in   positions, and slammed White House press secretary Sean Spicer for saying Syrian leader Bashar   ’s actions were worse than Adolf Hitler’s. ”Spicer made a terrible mistake yesterday,” Coffman began. ”If you’re not familiar with what he did. ..” But the audience let it be known that it wanted no excuses about Spicer. Throwing up his hands, Coffman finally said about Spicer: ”He needs to go.” Coffman could have a tough reelection fight next year against newly announced Democratic candidate Jason Crow. Party strategists hope that Crow’s background as an Army ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as his newcomer status to politics, will make him a strong challenger to Coffman, who was first elected to the House in 2008.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it views the House race in Colorado’s 6th Congressional District here    an area that includes Aurora and its surrounding suburbs    among the top 10 most competitive in 2018.  Democrats are feeling especially optimistic following a special house election in Kansas Tuesday night. GOP candidate Ron Estes won the contest by a far smaller margin than was expected in a district that Trump had won by double digits    a warning sign of an energized Democratic base ahead of 2018.  Wednesday marked Coffman’s first   town hall this year.  He confronted frustrated constituents during a local    in January, as emboldened Republican lawmakers in Washington were gearing up to repeal Obamacare. Coffman left that event early even as a crowd was waiting to get face time with the congressman    a move that drew wide criticism. Susan Gilbert, a high school teacher from Aurora, attended that event in January. She came to Wednesday night’s town hall for another opportunity to get to know her congressman better.  A Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, Gilbert said she was surprised to see Coffman caught off guard by the sheer number of constituents who showed up to voice their concerns in January.   ”If he was listening to the public and looking at all the letters and phone calls and postcards, he should have been more perceptive,” Gilbert said. Gilbert said immigration is among her top issues    in large part because many of her own students are undocumented. ”Many of my students are living in fear right now, some have already left the country because they are fearful of being deported,” she said.   Plenty of Coffman’s Republican colleagues have also faced hostile crowds back home in recent months over issues like health care reform and immigration.  Some voters have also taken on lawmakers for what they say is the GOP’s inability to hold Donald Trump accountable, as an endless stream of controversies have dogged the first months of the Trump presidency. This is certain to be a major attack line that Democrats deploy in the 2018 midterms, particularly if the president remains deeply unpopular. During the 2016 election, Coffman sharply distanced himself from    Trump, even vowing in a campaign ad to ”stand up to” his party’s nominee.  But on Wednesday, some of his constituents weren’t sold that Coffman was standing up to the president. One man who identified himself as a registered Republican stood up at Wednesday’s town hall to say he was ”shocked” to learn of Coffman’s support for wholesale repeal of Obamacare. ”That’s not the way we do things here in Colorado. The ACA is the law of the land,” the man said. ”What will you do to revise, strengthen and bolster Obamacare?” Phil Laxar of Centennial said Coffman’s public support for the Republican proposal to repeal Obamacare was the single issue that disturbed him most. ”Our district voted strongly against Donald Trump and while Rep. Coffman was reelected, it seems like he is supporting Trump’s policies instead of representing his constituents,” Laxar, who voted for Clinton, told CNN. ”In particular, the recent   health care act, which he didn’t have an opportunity to vote for but he did support publicly, which would be a disaster for the citizens of his district,” he added.

                Why Keeping Only the Popular Parts of Obamacare Won’t Work - The New York Times
            </div>
            <div class='content zoomable-text'>
                <div class='content-inner'>
                    Before Obamacare, it could be hard to buy your own insurance if you’d already had a health problem like cancer. An insurance company might have decided not to sell any insurance to someone like you. It might have agreed to cover you, but not cover cancer care. Or it might have offered you a comprehensive policy, but at some incredibly high price that you could never have paid. Donald J. Trump says he wants to do away with much of Obamacare, but he has signaled that parts of the law that banned those practices are good policy he’d want to keep. “I like those very much,” he told The Wall Street Journal last week about the law’s rules that prevent discrimination based on   conditions. The   conditions policies are very popular. Nearly everyone has relatives or friends with illnesses in their past  —   cancer, arthritis, depression, even allergies  —   that could have shut them out of the individual insurance markets before Obamacare, so it’s an issue that hits close to home for many Americans. But keeping those provisions while jettisoning others is most likely no fix at all. Those policies that make the insurance market feel fairer for sick Americans who need it can really throw off the prices for everyone else. That’s why Obamacare also includes less popular policies designed to balance the market with enough young, healthy people. Imagine you’re that patient with cancer. You really want health insurance, and you’re probably willing to pay a lot to get it. If the law requires insurance companies to offer you a policy, you are very likely to buy it. Now imagine you’re a young, healthy person without any health problems. Your budget is tight, and health insurance is expensive. You might decide you’ll be fine without insurance, since you can always buy it later, when you’re the one with a pessimistic diagnosis. Before Obamacare, several states tried policies like this, and required insurance companies to sell insurance to everyone at the same price, regardless of health histories. The results were nearly the same everywhere: Prices went way up enrollment went way down and insurance companies fled the markets. Some states hobbled along with small, expensive markets. Some experienced total market collapse and repealed the policies. Prices in those markets typically became so high that they were really a good deal only for people who knew they’d use a lot of health care services. And the sicker the insurance pool got, the more the companies would charge for their health plans. The health law attempts to broaden the pool by offering financial assistance to   people. By limiting how much people can be asked to pay for insurance, the law’s subsidies help make the purchase more attractive for healthier customers. That’s the law’s carrot. Then there’s the stick: The law says that if you don’t buy insurance, and you could have afforded it, you have to pay a fine. That rule is designed to discourage people from gaming the system by waiting until they’re sick. The mandate remains the law’s least popular provision. New York is a great case study. Before Obamacare, it had the   conditions policy, but without subsidies or a mandate. When the Obamacare rules kicked in, premiums there went down by 50 percent. This year, Obamacare premiums have risen substantially  —   an average of 22 percent around the country  —   leading many experts and politicians to question whether the law’s incentives were strong enough. Some, including Hillary Clinton, have argued that the government should sweeten the carrot, by making the subsidies more generous. Others have said that the stick should sting more by forcing the uninsured to pay a bigger penalty for sitting out of the market. Republican politicians have tended to criticize both of the incentive provisions. The subsidies have been attacked as excessive government spending. The mandate has been criticized as an inappropriate use of government power. Both have been the subject of big Supreme Court cases challenging the law. Both would have been eliminated under a bill passed by Congress but vetoed by President Obama last year. Taking away those unpopular pieces of the law and keeping the popular   conditions piece might seem like a political win. But it would result in a broken system. When Mitt Romney was devising the Massachusetts health reform law that would become the model for Obamacare, he hoped to set up a marketplace for health plans with some financial assistance for   people to buy insurance. What he didn’t want was a mandate. Then Jonathan Gruber, an M. I. T. economist who had calculated the results, showed him the numbers: His plan would cover only a third of the uninsured and cost   as much as an identical plan with a mandate. Mr. Romney embraced the mandate. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2007, he, too, advocated a   health reform system. He, too, said he did not support a mandate. Then he became president, and economists brought him the numbers. By the time the Affordable Care Act passed, he had changed his mind. We’ll see what happens when the economists bring the numbers to Mr. Trump. His transition website suggests that he might develop a different solution to the problem: a special, separate insurance market just for sick people. But that plan is different from the more modest amendments to the Affordable Care Act he described to The Wall Street Journal. It won’t be easy to keep the basic architecture of Obamacare while plucking out its least popular pieces. (Another provision that Mr. Trump says he likes, the requirement that insurers cover young adults on their parents’ policies, would be easier to save.) Last year, I spoke with Mark Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University who studied the states that had tried   conditions bans before Obamacare. One of the Supreme Court cases threatened to wipe out the mandate and the subsidies, and I asked him what would happen if the litigants succeeded. “It would be a big mess,” he said.
